   iris.h  —  interactive machine learning for handmade instruments
   v0.2.0 · one file · C99 · no dependencies · no allocation · no C library

   You show it a handful of examples of "when I do THIS, it sounds like THAT".
   It learns a mapping and fills in everything in between.

   This is the whole brain of the instrument. The same file compiles for a
   laptop, a web browser and an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, because it contains
   no hardware, no operating system and no library calls. It is arithmetic on
   memory you hand it. It is also meant to be read: the PARTS below explain
   the mathematics as they implement it, and the words it uses are defined at
   the end of this block.

   USAGE
     static unsigned char mem[IRIS_ARENA(2, 12, 3, 64)];
     iris *k = iris_init(mem, sizeof mem, 2, 12, 3, 64, 12345);

     iris_record(k, gesture, sound);     // do this a few times
     iris_train(k);                      // fit them, starting from the seed
     iris_predict(k, gesture, sound);    // now play

   A bad take is repaired the same way: iris_delete_id, then iris_train
   again. iris_train starts over from the instrument's seed every time, so a
   deleted take leaves nothing behind in the weights.

   THE THREE RULES THIS FILE OBEYS
     1. No allocation. You give it one block of memory, the arena, and it
        never asks for more, so you know exactly how much memory the
        instrument uses before the program runs.
     2. No C library. No printf, no math.h: the square root, the
        nonlinearity and the checksum are written out in this file.
     3. Single precision on the playing path. The ESP32-S3 does 32-bit
        float arithmetic in hardware and 64-bit double arithmetic in slow
        software. The one place that uses doubles is the leave-one-out sweep
        shared by iris_loo_error and iris_suggest_smoothing (PART 8), a
        diagnostic that never runs while you play, which adds up its squared
        misses in double on purpose so that the small ones keep their
        precision.

   NO DEPENDENCIES, EXACTLY. The file includes <stddef.h> and <stdint.h>,
   which define types and nothing else. A translation unit that calls every
   function in it, compiled with

       -std=c99 -ffreestanding -fno-stack-protector              (clang)
       -std=c99 -ffreestanding -fno-stack-protector
                -fno-tree-loop-distribute-patterns                (GCC)

   at -O0, -O1, -O2, -O3 and -Os, as C and as C++, has no undefined symbol
   and links with -nostdlib -static, with no C library at all: Apple clang,
   Homebrew clang 22 and gcc-15 on a 64-bit ARM Mac, and Debian's gcc 14 and
   clang 19 on 64-bit ARM Linux (as C). No flag changes an output bit. Each
   stops the COMPILER, not this code, from reaching for the C library:

     -ffreestanding        without it clang turns the loops that zero or
                           copy an array into calls to memset, memcpy, bzero
                           and, on macOS, memset_pattern16.
     -fno-stack-protector  where stack protection is on by default (clang on
                           macOS), every function with an array calls
                           __stack_chk_fail.
     -fno-tree-loop-distribute-patterns   GCC turns the same loops into
                           memset, memcpy and memmove calls even under
                           -ffreestanding.

   tests/freestanding.sh checks all of this, and rebuilds without each flag
   to show what that flag keeps out.

   ON THE ESP32-S3 THE LIST IS NOT EMPTY, AND EVERY ENTRY IS THE COMPILER'S.
   With the chip's own compiler (xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gcc, the GCC flags above,
   at -O0, -O2 and -Os):

     the playing path     __divsf3 and nothing else. That path is iris_init,
                          iris_record, iris_train, iris_predict, iris_novelty,
                          the neighbour functions, the deletes and iris_clear.
     the whole file       also __adddf3 __divdf3 __extendsfdf2 __floatsidf
                          __ledf2 __muldf3 __subdf3 __truncdfsf2, the
                          double-precision routines of the leave-one-out
                          sweep (rule 3).

   __divsf3 is single-precision division. The chip's floating-point unit has
   divide-step instructions but no single instruction that divides two
   floats, so every float division is a call to this routine in libgcc, the
   compiler's own support library (an Arduino build calls a copy in the
   chip's read-only memory). None of these is a C library function, none is
   a call this source writes, and all of them are in every Arduino build
   anyway. tests/freestanding.sh requires exactly this list.

   HOW LONG TRAINING TAKES, AND WHERE EACH NUMBER COMES FROM. iris_train runs
   until the error stops improving, under a ceiling (PART 8). The epochs it
   takes depend on the data:

     host      On the development laptop (an Apple M4 Max, Apple clang -O2),
               20 demonstrations of the reference task in tests/audit.c
               (2 inputs, 12 hidden units, 3 outputs) take 18,000 epochs and
               about 31 ms; 50 demonstrations take 12,000 epochs and about
               52 ms. `sh build.sh audit` prints these in its training-cost
               table.
     board     Measured on an ES3C28P (ESP32-S3, 240 MHz) on 2026-09-25 by
               the starter kit's board_probe sketch (log in
               docs/board/2026-09-25-es3c28p.txt): iris_train takes 10.6 s
               for 10 demonstrations of the reference task, 13.4 s for 20
               (18,000 epochs) and 22.1 s for 50; one slice of 64 epochs at
               20 demonstrations takes 48 ms; iris_train_elm takes 1.5 ms
               for 20 and 3.5 ms for 50.

   A sketch that must keep drawing while it trains takes the same run in
   slices, iris_train_begin and iris_train_slice, which is bit-identical to
   iris_train.

   iris_continue(k, n) and iris_continue_to_plateau carry on from the
   weights the instrument already holds: the warm trainers. iris_continue is
   the fixed-epoch update of Weka's MultilayerPerceptron, the network
   Wekinator ships, and tests/audit.c pins its output to the bit. Read their
   hazard in PART 8 before using either.

   THE WORDS THIS FILE USES, defined once, here.

     ACTIVATION   what a unit of the network outputs after its squashing
                  function; also used for the squashing function itself.
     ARENA        the one block of memory you give iris_init. Everything the
                  instrument knows lives inside it; IRIS_ARENA computes its
                  size.
     BACKPROPAGATION  the training method of PART 8: run a demonstration
                  forward, measure the miss, and work backwards to how much
                  each weight contributed to it.
     BINARY32, BINARY64  the 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point formats of
                  IEEE 754, the floating-point standard of the Institute of
                  Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which every processor
                  iris targets follows. C calls them float and double.
     BIT-IDENTICAL  equal in every bit, not merely close.
     C99, ISO C   the 1999 edition of the C standard, which this file is
                  written to; "ISO C" means a compiler mode that follows the
                  standard without GNU extensions (-std=c99, not -std=gnu99).
     CHOLESKY     a standard, fast way to solve a symmetric system of linear
                  equations, by factoring its matrix into a triangular matrix
                  times that triangle's mirror image. Used once, in PART 8d.
     CLAMP        hold a value inside limits: below the lower limit it becomes
                  the lower limit, above the upper it becomes the upper.
     CLANG, GCC   the two C compiler families the tests use; GCC is the GNU
                  Compiler Collection, and "GNU mode" means its -std=gnu...
                  settings, which the Arduino build uses. The ESP32-S3,
                  Cortex-M and AVR toolchains are GCC. Apple clang is the
                  clang that ships with macOS.
     CRC-32       a cyclic redundancy check: a 32-bit checksum over a saved
                  file, which catches accidental corruption but not
                  deliberate editing. PART 9.
     DEMONSTRATION  one recorded pair: these sensor readings go with those
                  output values. Also called an example or a take.
     ELM          extreme learning machine, the closed-form trainer: the
                  hidden layer keeps its random starting weights and only the
                  output layer is solved, exactly, in one step. PART 8d.
     EPOCH        one pass over every demonstration you have recorded.
                  Training is thousands of these: "9,000 epochs" means the
                  network saw each of your takes 9,000 times.
     ERROR        how far the network's outputs are from the demonstrated
                  ones. MEAN SQUARED ERROR is the average of the squared
                  misses; ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE error is its square root, in the
                  units of the miss. Training errors in this file are in the
                  network's own output units, where each output's
                  demonstrated range spans 0.1 to 0.9 (PART 5).
     FLOAT        a number stored in binary32: a sign, an 8-bit exponent and
                  24 significant bits, about seven significant decimal digits.
     FNV-1a       the Fowler-Noll-Vo hash, a simple byte-by-byte hash. The
                  tests use it to reduce an instrument to one 32-bit number.
     FUSED MULTIPLY-ADD  one instruction that computes a*b + c with a single
                  rounding instead of two. It changes the last bit of a
                  result, so this file forbids it in its own code (the
                  determinism contract below). CONTRACTION is the compiler
                  turning a*b + c into one.
     GEOMETRIC MEAN  the average of a set of ratios taken by multiplying
                  them and taking the root, so that twice as good and twice
                  as bad cancel. The comparisons below that give one average
                  ratios of errors this way.
     GOLDEN HASH  the FNV-1a hash of the bits a fixed recipe produces,
                  compared in the tests, so any change to the arithmetic
                  fails a check. tests/audit.c pins 0x6805FB0D.
     GRADIENT     for each weight, how much the error would change if that
                  weight moved a little. Training steps every weight against
                  its gradient, which is downhill (PART 8).
     HELD-OUT ERROR  the error at points the instrument was not trained on,
                  measured against the target a test knows is true: how well
                  it fills the gaps between your takes, which is what you
                  play. Compare RECALL.
     HIDDEN LAYER  the middle layer of the network, between the inputs and
                  the outputs (PART 6); its units are HIDDEN UNITS.
     IDE          integrated development environment: the Arduino IDE is the
                  program most students write and upload sketches with.
     k-NN, 1-NN   k-nearest-neighbour: answer a gesture with a blend of the
                  k stored demonstrations nearest to it. 1-nearest-neighbour
                  (k = 1) returns the single nearest one. PART 10.
     LEAVE-ONE-OUT  hide one demonstration, train on the rest, see how far
                  off the hidden one you land; repeat for each and average.
     LEARNING RATE, MOMENTUM  how big each training step is, and how much of
                  the previous step it carries on with (PART 8). Internal:
                  every instrument trains with 0.10 and 0.85.
     LOGIT        the inverse of the sigmoid: the sum a unit must reach for its
                  sigmoid to output a given value (PART 8d solves in it).
     MLP          multilayer perceptron: the network of PARTS 6 and 8, here
                  with one hidden layer.
     NIME         the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical
                  Expression. "Fiebrink and Sonami, NIME 2020" is Rebecca
                  Fiebrink and Laetitia Sonami, "Reflections on Eight Years of
                  Instrument Creation with Machine Learning", its 2020
                  proceedings, pages 237-242.
     NaN          not-a-number: the value a float takes after 0/0 or
                  infinity minus infinity. Every comparison with it is false
                  and any arithmetic with it gives NaN again, so one of them
                  spreads through everything it touches. The comments spell
                  it out as not-a-number.
     NORMAL MATRIX  the square matrix that least-squares fitting produces
                  and Cholesky then solves.
     NORMALISED   put on a fixed scale: every input onto -1..+1 across its
                  demonstrated range, every output onto 0.1..0.9 (PART 5).
     ODR          the one-definition rule: C and C++ require a thing to be
                  defined identically everywhere it appears.
     PLATEAU      the stretch of a training run where the error has stopped
                  falling by much; iris_train stops at one unless its error
                  floor or its ceiling stops it first (PART 8).
     PRE-ACTIVATION  the weighted sum a unit computes before its squashing
                  function is applied.
     RECALL       how closely a trained instrument plays back its own
                  demonstrations: the error at the demonstrated points.
                  Good recall with a poor HELD-OUT ERROR means the network
                  has fitted the noise in the takes rather than the mapping.
     RIDGE        a small number added down the diagonal of the normal matrix
                  before solving it, which stops the solve failing when two
                  demonstrations nearly repeat and pulls the answer toward
                  smaller weights. PART 8d.
     SANITIZER    compiler instrumentation that stops a program at a fault:
                  AddressSanitizer at an out-of-bounds memory access,
                  UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer at an operation C leaves
                  undefined (a misaligned access, a signed overflow).
     SATURATE     a squashing function saturates when its input is so far
                  from zero that its output sits at, or nearly at, its limit,
                  where a small change to the input no longer moves it.
     SEED         the number the random starting weights are drawn from. The
                  same seed always gives the same weights; a new seed is a
                  reroll. A seed of 0 is taken as 1.
     SIGMOID, TANH  the two S-shaped squashing functions (PART 1): tanh runs
                  from -1 to +1 and the sigmoid from 0 to 1.
     STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT  nudging the weights after each single
                  demonstration, visited in a shuffled order, rather than
                  once after all of them. It is how PART 8 trains.
     SUBNORMAL    a float so close to zero that the format gives up
                  precision to represent it (also called denormal). Some
                  processors flush them to zero in hardware.
     TRANSLATION UNIT  one .c file together with everything it includes.
     ULP          unit in the last place: the gap between a float and the
                  next one. "1 ulp" is the smallest change a float can make.
     WEIGHT, BIAS  the numbers the network learns. A weight scales one
                  connection; a bias shifts a unit's sum whatever comes in.
     WEKA, WEKINATOR  Weka is a Java machine-learning toolkit; Wekinator,
                  Rebecca Fiebrink's tool for building instruments from
                  demonstrations, trains Weka's MultilayerPerceptron and
                  nearest-neighbour classifier. iris rebuilds that loop for
                  boards with no operating system.

   The hardware named in comments: Arduino, the family of microcontroller
   boards (and the IDE) most students start with; the ESP32 family and the
   ESP32-S3, the Espressif microcontroller the starter kit uses, with an
   Xtensa LX7 processor core; AVR, the 8-bit processor of the Arduino Uno and
   Mega; RP2040 and STM32, other 32-bit microcontrollers; ARM, the processor
   family of phones, Apple-silicon Macs and the Raspberry Pi, whose
   Cortex-M cores are its microcontrollers; x86 and x86-64, the processors of
   most other laptops, and x87, the old floating-point unit of 32-bit x86;
   RISC-V and PowerPC, two more processor families; and WebAssembly, the
   portable instruction format web browsers run.

   THE WHOLE INTERFACE

   Forty-one functions, three types, and the macros listed at the end. `k` is
   the instrument. `in` and `out` are plain float arrays you own: `in` holds
   n_in floats and `out` n_out, and nothing checks their length, so an array
   shorter than the instrument's shape is read or written past its end.
   Anything named iris_internal_ is part of how the file works, not of what
   it promises, and can change in any release.

   LIFECYCLE
     size_t   iris_size(n_in, n_hid, n_out, cap)   arena bytes for a shape; 0
                                                    if the shape is refused
     iris    *iris_init(mem, bytes, n_in, n_hid, n_out, cap, seed)
                                                    build an instrument in your

     uint32_t iris_seed(k)                          the seed in use

     The four numbers are how many sensor values come in, how wide the
     hidden layer is (12 is a good answer, 8 the minimum), how many values
     go out, and how many demonstrations can be stored. They must match the
     four you gave IRIS_ARENA.

   DEMONSTRATIONS
     int  iris_record(k, in, out)         store one; its identifier (1 or
                                          more), or 0 if refused
     int  iris_count(k)                   how many are stored
     int  iris_capacity(k)                how many can be
     int  iris_get(k, idx, in, out)       copy one out; its identifier, or 0
     int  iris_index_of(k, id)            position of an identifier, or -1
     int  iris_id_at(k, idx)              identifier at a position, or -1
     int  iris_delete_id(k, id)           delete by identifier; 1, or 0
     int  iris_delete_index(k, idx)       delete by position; 1, or 0
     int  iris_delete_last(k)             delete the newest; 1, or 0
     int  iris_delete_nearest(k, in)      delete the one nearest this
                                          reading; 1, or 0
     void iris_clear(k)                   delete them all

   TRAINING
     int   iris_train(k)                  fit the demonstrations, starting
                                          from the seed; 1, or 0 if refused.
                                          THE ONE TO CALL.
     int   iris_train_begin(k, ceiling)   the same run, in slices: start it

   IRIS_FILE_HEADER, the save format's fixed values (PART 9); the iris_status
   values; IRIS_API, which you may define before the #include to change how
   every function is declared (the WebAssembly port marks them used); and
   IRIS_NO_GUARDS, which compiles the guards out and is for measuring them,
   not for instruments. Every other IRIS_ macro is part of how the file
   works, like the iris_internal_ names: it can change in any release, and
   defining one yourself is not supported.

   FAILURE, in two rules:
     A call that either works or does not returns 0 for "did nothing".
     A call that returns a MEASUREMENT returns it, or -1 if it refused.
   iris_get_status answers a different question: whether the INSTRUMENT is
   in trouble. Zero means opposite things in the two places. A RETURN VALUE
   of 0 is bad news (the call did nothing); a STATUS of 0 is good news
   (IRIS_STATUS_OK, nothing is wrong). The full account, with the one test
   that answers "did it train?" after every trainer and the places where the
   two rules give different answers to similar questions, is above
   iris_get_status.

   THREADING: never touch the same instrument from two places at once. The
   note above iris_get_status says why, and what that allows.

   Units: none. Feed it raw sensor readings. It fits its own range to
   whatever you actually give it, so scaling, centring or normalising them
   first gains nothing, and is one more thing to repeat exactly at play
   time.

   FLOAT DETERMINISM CONTRACT

/* 3. Forbid contraction in this file's code, and only there.

      Clang honours #pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT OFF at its default and at
      -ffp-contract=on: the instrument is then bit-identical to a
      -ffp-contract=off build. Clang IGNORES it under -ffp-contract=fast, so
      a -ffp-contract=fast clang build must also pass -ffp-contract=off.

      GNU compilers ignore the standard pragma and contract by default in
      every GNU mode (-std=gnu17; the Arduino IDE's -std=gnu++2a) and in ISO
      C++; only ISO C (-std=c99) leaves contraction off. They do honour
      #pragma GCC optimize ("fp-contract=off"), even under -ffp-contract=fast:
      built with gcc-15 -O2 -ffp-contract=fast, the golden hash in
      tests/audit.c holds with it and moves without it, and the
      ESP32-S3 compiler emits no fused instruction in this file with it and
      dozens without it (tests/pragma_leak.sh prints the count).

      BOTH ARE SCOPED TO THIS FILE. push_options saves GCC's optimisation
      settings, and pop_options, the last line of this file, restores them.
      On clang, float_control(push) saves the whole floating-point state and
      float_control(pop) at the end restores it. Just before that pop,
      STDC FP_CONTRACT DEFAULT puts contraction back to what the command
      line asks for, because clang honours float_control only on processors
      it supports strict floating point for (64-bit ARM, x86, RISC-V and
      PowerPC among them) and ignores it on the rest (32-bit ARM,
      WebAssembly, Xtensa and AVR among them, measured with clang 22), with
      a warning that the diagnostic lines around it keep out of your build.
      Code after the #include therefore compiles as it would without
      iris.h, contraction included where the compiler's default allows it,
      with one exception: on those other clang targets a contraction pragma
      of your own that comes BEFORE the #include gives way to the command
      line's setting, so put yours after it. tests/pragma_leak.sh checks this
      on the generated assembly: a*b+c in a function after the include still
      becomes a fused multiply-add, no iris function contains one, and on a
      laptop your own pragma before the include survives it.

      Two consequences. GCC does not inline a function that carries an
      optimize setting into a function whose settings differ, so when your
      code contracts, your calls into iris stay calls (measured with gcc-15);
      that is what keeps iris's arithmetic unfused inside your functions.
      And your own arithmetic is yours: a program that computes its
      demonstrations itself and needs the same bits from two compilers (a
      laptop and a board, say) switches contraction off in its own code too,
      as tests/audit.c does.                                                */

   ARE THE STACK BUDGET.

   Every working array in this file is sized by these numbers rather than by
   the shape you asked for: iris_internal_train_run alone reserves
   float x[IRIS_MAX_IN] and float t[IRIS_MAX_OUT], 192 bytes, whether your
   instrument has 32 inputs or 2. avr-gcc 7.3.0 -mmcu=atmega328p -Os
   -fstack-usage, with every function compiled on its own (IRIS_API defined
   empty), gives iris_internal_train_run a frame of 284 bytes and
   iris_predict 158. An Uno has 2 KB of memory in total and a sketch leaves a
   few hundred bytes of it for the stack, so the defaults do not fit it with
   room to spare.

   They are #ifndef so you can shrink them. Define them BEFORE including this
   file and every working array shrinks with them:

       #define IRIS_MAX_IN  4
       #define IRIS_MAX_OUT 4
       #define IRIS_MAX_HID 12
       #include "iris.h"

   With the same compiler and flags iris_internal_train_run, the deepest
   frame on the record/train/predict path, falls from 284 bytes to 124, a
   saving of 160, and iris_predict from 158 to 46. Inlined into its caller
   the path measures a little differently: in a sketch-like file that
   records, trains and predicts, built with -ffunction-sections, iris_train
   (which takes the training run inline) measures 280 bytes and 120 as GNU C
   (-std=gnu11), and as C99 main takes the whole path and measures 290 and
   130. These are
   single frames as the compiler reports them, not a measured run-time
   stack depth. The only rule is that the maxima must be at least the n_in,
   n_out and n_hid you pass to iris_init, which iris_init checks.
   On a 32-bit board (ESP32, RP2040, STM32) leave them alone; the defaults cost
   nothing you have. */

/* THE CAP KEEPS THE SIZE ARITHMETIC INSIDE 32 BITS.

   The bound exists to stop an overflow, not because 4,096 is musically
   special. IRIS_ARENA and iris_size multiply cap by (n_in + n_out) and by
   sizeof(float), in unsigned long, which C guarantees is at least 32 bits
   (see the note at IRIS_ARENA). An uncapped count could wrap that product,
   so that the arena check passed a buffer too small and the demonstration
   store ran off the end of it. At the maxima (32 in, 64 hidden, 16 out)
   4,096 demonstrations make an arena of 862,136 bytes on a 64-bit laptop,
   far below 2^32, so the product cannot wrap. The demonstrations alone are
   786,432 bytes there, already past the ESP32-S3's 512 KB of internal
   memory, so nothing a board can hold is refused.

   Where size_t is 16 bits, every Arduino AVR board, the cap is 255, and there
   it describes the boards rather than an overflow: an int count cannot wrap
   a 32-bit product, and a shape whose arena passes 65,535 bytes is refused

   iris_init at run time in C++ (the note at IRIS_ARENA). With avr-gcc 7.3.0

/* EVERY PRODUCT IS COMPUTED IN unsigned long, WHICH C GUARANTEES IS AT LEAST
   32 BITS, AND NOT IN size_t.

   On a 16-bit size_t target, every Arduino AVR board, products taken in
   size_t wrap. That alone would be survivable if anything noticed, but
   iris_size would wrap IDENTICALLY, so iris_init would compare a wrapped
   need against an equally wrapped array size and could not refuse: computed
   in size_t, IRIS_ARENA(24,63,16,254) comes out as 88 bytes for an
   instrument that needs 65,624, and the first loop of iris_reseed writes
   6,048 bytes into those 88 (avr-gcc for the atmega328p).

   Computing wide makes the true number appear. In C, that number is then too
   large for an array and the COMPILER refuses the declaration -- a build error
   naming the array, which is the outcome we want.

   IN C++ IT IS A RUNTIME REFUSAL INSTEAD, AND ARDUINO COMPILES .ino AS C++.
   An array declarator's size in C++ converts to std::size_t, 16 bits on AVR, so
   the bound wraps silently where C errors. avr-g++ for the atmega328p, each
   line checked as a compile-time assertion:

     IRIS_ARENA(24,63,16,254)          65624   (wide, correct)
     sizeof mem                           88   (the ARRAY narrowed)
     iris_size(24,63,16,254)               0   (cannot be sized here)

   The narrowing threshold and the sizing threshold are the SAME number, so
   every shape the array silently shrinks is a shape iris_size refuses: the
   `need == 0` test in iris_init returns 0 and the sketch gets a null pointer,
   which every example in this repository checks. So the failure is loud, just
   later than it should be: a refusal at run time rather than a build error,
   and never a write past the array. */

   past its refusals, a successful closed-form solve, iris_reseed and a
   successful iris_load set it back to IRIS_STATUS_OK, and iris_record
   clears IRIS_STORE_FULL. A later healthy call does not: after a

   good readings until the next training run.

/* THE WEIGHT LIMIT. A weight or bias past it means training is running away:
   the guard in PART 8 clamps it to exactly this value, reports
   IRIS_TRAINING_DIVERGED and stops the run, and a trainer that would continue
   from a weight sitting on it refuses with IRIS_DIVERGED_STUCK.
   iris_internal_tanh is exactly ±1 beyond |s| = 3, so one weight of 16 on its
   own saturates its hidden unit whenever its input is more than 3/16 of the
   way from the centre of its range to either end.

   IT FIRES ON SOME GOOD FITS. Measured with iris_train at the defaults on
   2,304 fits (6 target shapes x 5, 10, 20, 50 demonstrations x noise 0, 0.05,
   0.10 x 32 seeds; 2 inputs, 12 hidden, 3 outputs): the healthy fits' largest
   weight has a median of 4.07, a 99th percentile of 14.4 and a maximum of
   15.9953, and the limit fired on 40, every one at 50 demonstrations and 39
   of them on sharp targets (cliffs and ridges). Those 40 are usable
   instruments, and stopping them helped: allowed to run on (a limit of 32 or
   64 gives the same runs; none passes 31.2) they train longer and end 7.6%
   worse on held-out error (geometric mean; 27 of the 40 are worse). Their
   status still says they diverged, and the warm trainers refuse them.

   WHY IT IS NOT RAISED. A higher limit clears those 40 and blinds the guard
   to real runaways. Same 2,304 datasets with the learning rate (lr) and
   momentum forced through iris_internal_set_learning; of the fits whose
   held-out error came out more than twice the default fit's, how many the
   guard reported:

                                  limit 16       limit 32       limit 64
     lr 2.0,  momentum 0.85     512 of 1,718    60 of 1,720     0 of 1,720
     lr 0.10, momentum 0.99     743 of 1,229   228 of 1,257     0 of 1,257
     lr 2.0,  momentum 0.99   1,970 of 1,970 1,967 of 1,978 1,579 of 1,992

   against 40, 0 and 0 reports on the default fits. 16 stays. The golden
   training hash in tests/audit.c is the same at all three limits: no healthy
   reference run comes near it.

   IT IS A DETECTOR FOR GRADIENT TRAINING, NOT A RULE ABOUT INSTRUMENTS. The
   closed-form trainer (PART 8d) solves the output layer directly, and its
   answer can lie beyond the limit without anything having run away: 155 of
   2,000 solves at 12 hidden units and lam0 1e-4 have an output weight past
   16, 132 of 2,000 at 24, the largest 42.6, and none of 2,000 at 48 hidden
   units and lam0 1e-3 (random sessions of 1 to 4 inputs and outputs and 5 to
   104 demonstrations of smooth targets with a little noise). Such an
   instrument plays, saves and loads like any other; a file needs its weights
   finite, nothing more (PART 9). What it cannot do is carry on with gradient
   training: a trainer that continues from the current weights
   (iris_continue or iris_continue_to_plateau) clamps every weight past the
   limit in its first epoch and reports IRIS_TRAINING_DIVERGED, and from then
   on refuses with IRIS_DIVERGED_STUCK. iris_train, which starts
   over from the seed, is the way from the closed-form trainer to
   backpropagation (tests/elm.c checks all of this). */

   PART 1 — MATH WE PROVIDE OURSELVES

   This file cannot call math.h, so the few functions the network needs are
   written here: a squashing function, a square root and a random number
   generator. The squashing function is the hot one. With 2 inputs, 12
   hidden units and 3 outputs the network calls it 15 times per
   demonstration per epoch (once per hidden unit, and once inside each
   output's sigmoid), so 20 demonstrations trained for 18,000 epochs make
   5.4 million calls.

   The reason for writing them here is the no-library rule, not speed, but
   the squashing function below also happens to be cheaper than the C
   library's: on the development laptop, the same network trained with
   tanhf takes 53% longer per epoch. It has not been timed on the ESP32-S3.
   ========================================================================== */

/* THE NONLINEARITY, AND WHY IT IS FROZEN.

   p(x) = x(27+x^2)/(27+9x^2), clamped to [-1, +1].

   This is a rational approximation to tanh, the S-shaped curve that runs
   from -1 to +1. Near zero it is almost a straight line and far out it
   flattens against its limits, and that bend is what lets a network of
   these units draw a curved mapping instead of a flat one. Its largest
   distance from true tanh is 0.0235, near x = 1.566 (every float from 0 to
   20 compared with tanhf).

   Two exact facts make the clamp the right one:
   p(x) - 1 = (x-3)^3/(27+9x^2), so p(3) = 1 EXACTLY, and
   p'(x) = ((x^2-9)/(3(3+x^2)))^2 >= 0, so p only ever rises and is flat at 3.
   Past |x| = 3 the formula would climb above 1, so the RETURN VALUE is
   clamped, which keeps every output inside [-1, +1] whatever rounding does.
   Clamping the argument at 3 instead would not: rounding lets 10,220 floats
   between 2.5 and 3 evaluate above 1.0f. The two clamps give different
   answers for 20,671 non-negative floats (and as many negative ones), each
   time by one ulp. The clamp is branch-free, so its cost does not depend on
   the data.

   WHY THIS FUNCTION AND NOT TRUE tanh. It is cheaper and no worse. Measured
   against true tanh and against a rational approximation 245 times more
   accurate, on 2,304 paired runs (6 synthetic target shapes, 5 to 50
   demonstrations, 3 noise levels, 32 seeds, iris_train, held-out error on a
   41 x 41 grid): the accurate function's held-out error is 1.3% higher as a
   geometric mean, higher on 57.1% of the pairs, and only 0.2% higher with
   the one saturating target left out, which is far less than a reroll of
   the seed changes on the same data. It costs 12% more per epoch and 18%
   more per prediction. So it did not win a contest by much, and it is not a
   compromise either. It is FROZEN because saved instruments depend on it: a
   file's weights mean what they mean only through this exact function.

   CONSEQUENCE. (1 - a*a) is the derivative of TRUE tanh, not of this
   function, so the backward pass in PART 8 is a surrogate gradient: it
   points downhill, never with the wrong sign (the clamp keeps a inside
   [-1, +1]), and it is under-scaled by 2.4-3.3% in aggregate
   (docs/MATH-FIXES.md, defect 1). Training with the exact derivative instead
   makes no measurable difference on the same 2,304 pairs (geometric mean of
   held-out error 0.997, with a 95% confidence interval, the range the true
   ratio lies in at 95% confidence, of 0.988 to 1.005).

   The +/-1e9 test keeps x*(27+x^2) finite; it is not where p saturates,
   which is |x| = 3. It is needed because iris_predict does not clamp its
   input: a reading of 1e20 on an input demonstrated between 0 and 1 arrives
   here as a sum near 1e20, where both halves of the ratio overflow to infinity
   and infinity over infinity is not-a-number, so every hidden unit would be
   not-a-number. With the test that reading plays an ordinary output with a
   healthy status. */

/* THE SQUARE ROOT, in integers, correctly rounded.

   Four places take a square root: iris_reseed (the starting weight scales,
   1/sqrt(inputs) and 1/sqrt(hidden units)), iris_novelty (the distance it
   reports, and the sqrt(inputs) it divides that by), and the closed-form
   trainer (its gain, 2/sqrt(inputs), and the diagonal of every Cholesky
   step). A compiler's square root is one instruction on a laptop, but on the
   ESP32-S3 it is a call to the C library's sqrtf, and on GCC and Linux clang
   it also calls sqrtf for a negative input so that errno, the C library's
   error variable, can be set. A call
   is an undefined symbol in a freestanding build, and it makes the answer
   belong to whichever C library is linked. This function needs nothing and
   gives the same bits on every target.

   THE METHOD is long-hand square root, the way it is taught with decimal
   digits, done in base 2. Write x = m * 2^p, with m the float's 24
   significant bits as a whole number. Then
   sqrt(x) = sqrt(m * 2^25) * 2^((p - 25) / 2), after moving one factor of 2
   from the power into m whenever p - 25 is odd. The bits of sqrt(m * 2^25)
   come out one at a time, from the top, 25 of them.
   With q the root found so far and b the next bit to try, setting b grows
   the square from q*q to (q+b)*(q+b), an increase of 2*q*b + b*b, so the bit
   is kept exactly when the remainder (the number minus q*q) can pay for it.
   The loop stores the remainder divided by b, which makes the price 2*q + b,
   and moving on to the next bit, half as big, doubles the stored remainder.
   Every quantity stays below 2^27, so 32-bit integers suffice.

   CORRECTLY ROUNDED means the answer is the float nearest the true root. 25
   bits come out: the 24 a float holds and one more, which says whether the
   true root lies above or below the point halfway to the next float. A
   nonzero remainder says something is left further down, so a 1 in that
   extra bit then means past halfway, and the root rounds up. It can never
   land exactly on halfway: that root, doubled, would be an odd whole number,
   and so would its square, but the number being rooted is m shifted left by
   25 places, which is even. IEEE 754 requires exactly this of a hardware
   square root, so the result is the hardware's, bit for bit, for every input
   that has a root, and for -0 and NaN: tools/sqrt_exhaustive.c compares all
   2^32 bit patterns against the host's sqrtf, and tests/portability.c
   re-checks ten million of them on every run.

   Special values follow IEEE 754: sqrt(+0) = +0, sqrt(-0) = -0, sqrt(+infinity)
   = +infinity, a NaN comes back as the same NaN made quiet, and any other
   negative input gives NaN. None of the four places passes a negative
   number: the Cholesky step checks that its diagonal is positive first, and
   the others take the root of a count or of a sum of squares.

   THE PRICE IS SPEED: about 50 nanoseconds a call on the development laptop
   (an Apple M4 Max, Apple clang -O2), where the hardware instruction takes
   about 6. That adds about 45 nanoseconds to iris_novelty, 60 to
   iris_reseed, and 0.6 of the 5.0 microseconds a closed-form fit of 20
   demonstrations with 12 hidden units takes. It adds nothing to the
   neighbour searches (iris_knn_predict, iris_classify_1nn,
   iris_delete_nearest), which compare squared distances and never take a
   root. */

   a prediction from an instrument that was never fitted, a closed-form solve
   that collapsed to a constant. Those are the conditions a caller cannot
   detect for itself.

   It does NOT report an argument mistake: asking for demonstration 5,000 of
   twelve, say, or handing the closed-form trainer too little scratch. Those
   come back through the RETURN VALUE and leave the status alone, so that one
   out-of-range query cannot leave a polled screen showing a fault for ever.
   Check the return value of the call you made, and check the status for
   whether the instrument itself is in trouble. Two questions, two answers. */

/* THREADING, IN ONE SENTENCE.

       Never touch the same instrument from two places at once.

   That is the whole contract, and it is short because this file keeps no
   writable state outside the instrument you pass in: no global or static
   variables, no shared scratch. (Its one static object is a constant table
   in iris_suggest_smoothing, which nothing writes.) So two instruments
   cannot interact, on any number of cores.

   SAFE: many instruments on one core, one after another; one instrument per
   thread across as many cores as you have; one instrument used only inside an
   interrupt, but read the PLATFORM CAVEAT below before you do that last one.

   NOT SAFE: the SAME instrument from two threads, or from an interrupt and
   the main loop, even if both only play it. iris_predict, iris_knn_predict
   and iris_classify_1nn write inside the instrument (the network's working
   values, the status, and on an instrument never fitted the neighbour
   ranges), and iris_novelty fits those ranges too, which is why all four
   take a non-const iris *. An interrupt landing
   mid-call leaves both answers wrong. Give the interrupt its own instrument.
   Functions that take a const iris * write nothing, but reading an
   instrument while another thread writes it is still a race.

   PLATFORM CAVEAT, and it decides the interrupt case on the board this library
   is usually run on. Everything above is a statement about THIS CODE. It is
   not a promise about your chip. On an ESP32 under FreeRTOS, the real-time
   operating system its Arduino core runs on, the floating-point registers are
   not saved when an interrupt is taken (the core's configuration leaves
   CONFIG_FREERTOS_FPU_IN_ISR unset), so float arithmetic inside an interrupt
   handler, iris's or anyone's, can corrupt the interrupted task. iris is
   float throughout. So on that platform, do not call any iris_ function from
   an interrupt handler: read the sensor there, set a flag, and call iris from
   the main loop. The statement about the code stands wherever interrupt entry
   does save the floating-point registers.

   TIMING, for the audio case. One prediction of a 2-12-3 instrument takes
   14.95 microseconds on an ESP32-S3 at 240 MHz (the median over repeated
   batches; 99.9% of single calls finish within 19.8 and the worst took 47),
   measured by the starter kit's board_probe on 2026-09-25, log in
   docs/board/2026-09-25-es3c28p.txt. Against the 20.8 microseconds of one audio sample at 48 kHz that is
   1.4 times of margin, 72% of a core spent on playing alone. At a control
   rate of 1,000 predictions a second it is 1.5% of a core. On the
   development laptop one prediction takes about 0.04 microseconds. Training
   does not fit inside an audio callback: train in slices from the main loop
   (iris_train_slice), and never from an interrupt. */

/* HOW EVERY FUNCTION IN THIS FILE REPORTS FAILURE: two rules.

   BEFORE THE RULES, THE ONE LINE THAT ANSWERS "DID IT TRAIN?"

       trainer_of_your_choice(k);
       if (!iris_is_trained(k)) { ...it did not fit... }

   It is correct after EVERY trainer in this file, and no other test is.

   Here is why it has to exist. The two rules below are each sound, but they
   meet badly in C, and `if (trainer(...))` is wrong in BOTH directions
   depending on which trainer you called. The four trainers on the 20
   demonstrations of the reference task in tests/audit.c (2-12-3, seed 1234,
   each from a fresh reseed, the closed-form one at lam0 1e-4; the refusal is
   an empty store):

     on a fit that WORKED        return   if(return)   iris_is_trained
       iris_train                 1          true            1
       iris_continue(k, 600)      0.00012    true            1
       iris_continue_to_plateau   0.0000043  true            1
       iris_train_elm             0          FALSE           1   <-- best case

     on a fit that REFUSED
       iris_train                 0          false           0
       iris_continue(k, 600)     -1          TRUE            0   <-- -1 is truthy
       iris_continue_to_plateau  -1          TRUE            0
       iris_train_elm            -1          TRUE            0

   iris_train_elm returns the number of ridge doublings it needed, so 0 is
   its BEST outcome and reads as false. The warm trainers return a
   measurement, and -1 is an ordinary non-zero float, so a refusal reads as
   true. One more path returns -1 without being a refusal: when a gradient
   run meets a not-a-number partway (demonstrations spread wider than the
   largest float can span, say), its fit is lost, so it resets the
   instrument to its seed's starting weights, unfitted, sets
   IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED and returns -1 (iris_train returns 0), with
   iris_is_trained 0. iris_is_trained reads one flag that every trainer sets
   on success and none sets otherwise, so it gives the same answer whichever
   door you came in by. What it
   answers is whether the fit matches the demonstrations stored now: a call
   refused for a mistake in its arguments changes nothing, so an instrument
   trained before that call still reads 1 after it.

   RULE 1, for a call that either works or does not:
       0 means the call did nothing. Non-zero means it worked.
   That covers iris_init (a null pointer), iris_size, iris_record,
   iris_get, iris_train, iris_train_begin, the delete functions, iris_save
   and iris_load. iris_record returns the new demonstration's identifier,
   which is never 0 because identifiers start at 1, so it obeys the rule AND
   hands you the number you need later to delete that take; iris_get returns
   the identifier of the row it copied.

   RULE 2, for a call that returns a MEASUREMENT you asked for:
       the measurement on success, -1 on refusal.
   That covers iris_continue, iris_continue_to_plateau, iris_train_elm,
   iris_loo_error, iris_suggest_smoothing, iris_worst_example,
   iris_worst_example_id, iris_index_of, iris_id_at, iris_classify_1nn,
   iris_novelty and iris_example_stress. These cannot use rule 1 because 0 is
   often a good answer: a training error of 0 is a perfect fit, no ridge
   doublings is the best a solve can do, and a novelty of 0 means the
   reading is exactly on a demonstration.

   WHERE THE RULES DIFFER FOR SIMILAR QUESTIONS, so a table is worth having:
     - A position with no demonstration: iris_get answers 0 (rule 1: it
       copied nothing, and no identifier is 0) and iris_id_at answers -1
       (rule 2).
     - iris_train_elm's best outcome is 0 ridge doublings, which reads as
       false (the table above).
     - iris_set_smoothing returns nothing: a value outside 0 to 1 is clamped
       to the nearer end without a status, and iris_get_smoothing reports
       what was kept. Only a value that is not finite is refused, with
       IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED.
     - With no demonstrations stored, iris_predict writes 0 and reports
       IRIS_NOT_FITTED, while iris_knn_predict and iris_classify_1nn write 0
       (iris_classify_1nn also returns -1) and leave the status alone.

   THE READERS cannot fail and so answer every question: iris_count,
   iris_capacity, iris_seed, iris_is_trained, iris_last_error,
   iris_train_progress, iris_train_busy, iris_train_epochs_done and
   iris_get_smoothing answer a null instrument with 0 (iris_get_status with
   IRIS_NOT_FITTED). iris_train_slice returns 1 while its run has more to do
   and 0 once the run is over, whatever ended it.

   And a separate question, with a separate answer: is the INSTRUMENT in
   trouble? That is iris_get_status, below. A call can succeed on an
   instrument that is unwell, and a call can fail on a perfectly good one.
   A return value of 0 says the call did nothing; a status of 0
   (IRIS_STATUS_OK) says nothing is wrong.

/* Randomise the weights. This is the reroll.

   The scale matters. Each hidden unit adds up n_in incoming signals, so if
   the weights are too large the sum lands far out where tanh is flat, the
   error signal underneath it goes to nearly zero, and the network stops
   learning before it starts. Scaling each weight by one over the square root
   of the number of inputs to its unit keeps the sums in the responsive part
   of the curve. This is a standard trick and it is the difference between
   "trains in 50 ms" and "never trains at all".

   The code multiplies each draw by that reciprocal, rounded once to a float
   (s1 and s2 below), rather than dividing each draw by the square root. The
   two round differently: over seeds 1 to 1,000 at 2 inputs, 12 hidden units
   and 3 outputs, dividing would give a different float for 12 to 37 of the
   60 weights. The multiplication is the one the golden hash pins.

   A seed of 0 is taken as 1, because the random number generator cannot
   start from 0, so seeds 0 and 1 give the same instrument.

   TO REROLL a trained instrument, give it a new seed and train again:
   iris_reseed(k, new_seed) then iris_train(k), or iris_train_elm for the
   closed-form trainer (PART 8d). The random state starts again from the new
   seed. The new starting weights replace the old ones at once, so if the
   trainer then refuses -- no demonstrations, say -- the instrument is left
   unfitted and plays as one (IRIS_NOT_FITTED) until a trainer succeeds.

   A sliced run in flight ends here, as it does at iris_clear, a closed-form
   solve and a load: its remaining slices would train the new seed's weights
   inside the old run's session, with its shuffle, its epoch count and its
   plateau reference, and give an instrument that neither seed reproduces.

/* INTERNAL: the learning rate and momentum are not part of the interface,
   because a musician cannot choose them well and a wrong choice destroys the
   instrument. Measured with iris_train's plateau run on six synthetic target
   shapes, output noise 0.05, 40 seeds each:

   MOMENTUM 0.99, one nudge from the 0.85 default, diverges 11 to 39 of 40
   runs depending on the target, against none at the default. A diverged
   run leaves a weight pinned on IRIS_W_LIMIT, and every warm trainer then
   refuses the instrument with IRIS_DIVERGED_STUCK until iris_train starts it
   over.

   A LEARNING RATE OF 2.0 diverges only 4 of 16 runs on a clean smooth
   target, but leaves 15 of the 16 more than five times worse than the
   default on held-out error, 12 of them with a healthy status.

   THE SAFE RANGES BUY LITTLE THAT SMOOTHING DOES NOT. Tuned per task by an
   oracle (24 synthetic tasks at 3 noise levels), the learning rate, the
   weight decay and the epoch ceiling each improve held-out error by 22% to
   59% over the defaults and land within 8-10% of one another: three ways of
   saying how hard to chase the demonstrations. Smoothing is the one of the
   three that is exposed.

   AND THE ONE READOUT A SCREEN CAN SHOW POINTS BACKWARDS. At noise 0.10,
   across 7 learning rates on each of the 24 tasks, training error and
   held-out error move in opposite directions (mean rank correlation -0.63,
   where -1 would mean every step down in one is a step up in the other),
   and the setting with the lowest training error is the worst or
   second-worst instrument in 14 of the 24. A student tuning by the error
   readout picks the worst setting on offer.

   Kept as an internal hook: the tests use it to force divergences and wild
   settings (tests/audit.c, tests/train.c) and to check that a load puts the
   defaults back (tests/load.c). The clamps allow Weka's own pair, 0.3 and
   0.2. */

   target numbers to fit, and trained to a plateau on noisy takes it has the
   freedom to bend through the noise. The decay is the price it pays for
   bending.

   Applied as decoupled decay (to the weight itself, not folded into the
   gradient, so it does not build up in the momentum) and to the weights
   only, never the biases: penalising a bias just shifts the function, for no
   reduction in its freedom. Clamped to 0.3, the value smoothing 1 maps onto.

   Not comparable to scikit-learn's alpha, although the scale looks familiar:
   the ranges this file normalises by come from the demonstrations themselves

   On noisy takes smoothing repairs the plateau run, which otherwise fits the
   noise: at sigma 0.05 and above, smoothing 0 is 1.2 to 2.2 times worse than
   simply stopping after 100 epochs. On clean takes it costs 16%, 29% and 66%
   more held-out error at 10, 20 and 50 demonstrations. What it buys depends
   on the target: at sigma 0.10, smoothing 1 against smoothing 0 ranges from
   no gain to 4.1 times better across the six shapes, and on one periodic
   target at sigma 0.05 it is worse. Recall of the demonstrations gets
   steadily worse as smoothing rises, as it should; held-out error usually
   has its best value somewhere inside the range, not at either end. Every
   run above 0 in those measurements ended with a healthy status (0 of
   5,760).

   The default is 0, stick to the demonstrations, because a musician who has
   not asked for smoothing should get exactly what they showed it, and
   because no single value serves both clean and noisy takes. If your takes
   are noisy, audition a few values, or ask iris_suggest_smoothing for a
   starting point. */

   PART 5 — NORMALISATION

   Find the range of every input and output across the demonstrations, then
   map everything onto a common scale before training.

   Outputs go to 0.1-0.9 rather than 0-1 on purpose. The output layer uses a
   sigmoid. A true logistic only APPROACHES 0 and 1, so a target of exactly 1
   would push a weight toward infinity for ever. This sigmoid, built on the
   clamped rational of PART 1, does reach 1 (iris_internal_sigmoid(6.0f) is
   1.0f exactly), but the training signal through it, y*(1-y), is 0 there,
   so a target at either end would still drive the output into the flat
   region where it stops learning. Leaving headroom at both ends means the
   network can actually arrive.

   WHERE THE CONSTANT COMES FROM. 0.1/0.9 is a rule of thumb, not a derived
   value. LeCun's "Efficient BackProp" (section 4.5) derives a band from the
   maximum of the sigmoid's second derivative, 0.2113/0.7887, and against it
   0.1/0.9 gives 1.85 times less gradient at the targets (docs/MATH-AUDIT.md
   works it out). It stays because it is part of what a saved instrument plays
   (PART 9), not because it was measured to be better. It was not.

/* THE RANGES. Every input and every output gets the smallest and largest value
   the demonstrations gave it. Every trainer calls this before it starts; the
   neighbour functions (PART 10), iris_delete_nearest and iris_novelty call it
   on an instrument that has never been fitted. With no demonstrations it
   leaves the ranges as they are.

   AN INPUT THAT NEVER MOVED IS IGNORED. A switch left in one position, a
   sensor resting against its rail, a light sensor under steady light: an input
   that read the same in every demonstration tells the instrument nothing about
   what you want, and dividing by its width would turn the smallest wobble at
   play time into an enormous number. So the rule is:

       an input is STILL when its width, hi - lo, is at most 1e-5 of its
       magnitude (the larger of |lo| and |hi|), or at most 1e-6.

   A still input is stored with zero width (in_hi = in_lo), and
   iris_internal_norm_in gives it the value 0 -- in training and in playing,
   whatever it reads, so moving it cannot change what the instrument plays.
   A float carries about seven significant digits, so 1e-5 of the magnitude
   is fewer than 170 steps of the float's own resolution: a range that narrow
   is rounding and sensor noise, not a gesture. The 1e-6 covers inputs
   resting near zero, where a relative test alone would demand an exact zero.

   Why ignore it rather than give it a small width. Dividing by a width that
   small magnifies any movement at play time: an input held at 500 in every
   demonstration and given a width of 0.005 normalises to about 400 when it
   reads 501, where the demonstrations taught the network only [-1,+1].
   With such a floor in place of this rule, on the six demonstrations
   tests/playing.c uses with the still input at 500, a sweep of the other
   input spans 9.97 of the 10 demonstrated with the still input at 500, and
   0.0000 with it at 501: every hidden unit saturates and the instrument
   becomes a constant.

   AN OUTPUT THAT NEVER MOVED keeps a small nonzero width, because the network
   is trained toward it and the output scaling divides by the width. The rule:

       an output's width is at least max(1e-5 * |lo|, 1e-6), where lo is the
       smallest value it was shown; a narrower output gets hi = lo + that,
       or, when lo + that would pass the largest float, lo = hi - that.

   That floor is relative for the reason above: an absolute 1e-6 added to a
   value above 32 changes nothing in 32-bit floating point, because the gap
   between representable numbers there is already wider, so the width would
   stay zero and every prediction would be not-a-number. An absolute floor
   works up to 31.77 and fails from 32.72.

   The widening goes downward only at the very top of the float range: an
   output shown nothing below about 3.40279e38, within 1e-5 of the largest
   float, would get hi = infinity, and then the output scaling, the
   substitute a playing function writes (the centre of the range) and the
   saved file would all hold an infinity. Widened downward, both ends stay
   finite and lo < hi, so the instrument plays finite numbers and saves
   (tests/playing.c trains one with each trainer at the largest float).

   A LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN GUARDED. A width is a float, so demonstrations
   that span more than the largest float, about 3.4e38 end to end (values
   beyond about 1.7e38 on both sides of zero), give a width that overflows to
   infinity. Normalising a demonstration at either end of such a range then
   gives not-a-number, so training traps it partway through and leaves the
   instrument reseeded and unfitted (two inputs, one demonstrated at -2e38
   and 2e38: iris_train returns 0 with IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED), and iris_save
   refuses an instrument holding such a range (PART 9). No sensor reads
   numbers of that size. */

/* THE INPUT SCALING: each input maps to [-1,+1] across the range the

   Centred, not [0,1], because inputs that are all positive give every

   descent has to zig-zag toward the answer (LeCun et al. 1998, "Efficient
   BackProp", section 4.3). [-1,+1] is also what Weka's MultilayerPerceptron
   does with normalizeAttributes on, the setting Wekinator ships. Measured on

   [0,1] inputs: training mean squared error 5.94e-4 -> 6.38e-5 (9.3x), grid
   root-mean-square error 0.0129 -> 0.0084 (1.54x).

   A STILL INPUT (zero width, see iris_internal_fit_ranges) maps to 0 for every

     output_o = sigmoid( sum_h w2[o][h] * hidden_h + b2[o] )

   That is the network. Each hidden unit adds up the inputs, each scaled by
   its own weight, adds its bias, and squashes the sum; each output does the
   same with the hidden units' answers. A single unit can only draw one soft
   step across the input space. Adding a dozen of them, each with its step in
   a different place and direction, is what lets the output bend into the
   shape you demonstrated, and training (PART 8) is the search for weights
   that put the steps in the right places.

   It is NOT the whole of what iris_predict does; the full chain, which is
   what plays, is:

     x_i   = iris_internal_norm_in(k, i, your_reading)    scale the sensor in
     ...the two lines above...
     out_o = iris_internal_denorm_out(k, o, output_o)     scale the sound out

   Four steps, two of them arithmetic on ranges the instrument measured for
   itself, and two matrix multiplies with a squashing function after each.
   For 2 inputs, 12 hidden and 3 outputs that is 60 multiply-adds and 20
   float divisions (one in each input's scaling, one in each of the 15
   squashing functions, one in each output's scaling back), and on the
   ESP32-S3, which divides in a library routine, the divisions are most of
   the cost. One whole prediction takes 14.9 microseconds there, a board
   figure awaiting a recorded log (the timing note above iris_get_status),
   and about 0.04 microseconds on the development laptop. Training the same

   PART 7 — HOW LOST AM I?

   Distance from the current gesture to the nearest thing you demonstrated.
   0 means "exactly on an example".

   WHAT 1 MEANS, precisely, because the obvious reading is wrong. The distance
   is taken between normalised inputs, which run from -1 to +1 across each
   demonstrated range (PART 5), and divided by sqrt(n_in)/2 -- a constant that
   depends only on how many sensors you have, NOT on how far apart your
   demonstrations are. The normalised box has side 2 and diagonal
   2*sqrt(n_in), so 1 means "a quarter of that diagonal away from the nearest
   example": a quarter of every sensor's demonstrated range, in every sensor
   at once. That is a fixed distance, not a relative one. An input that never
   moved during the demonstrations adds nothing to the distance but still
   counts in n_in.

   The consequence is worth knowing before you map this to anything. With four
   corner demonstrations -- which is examples/00_minimal.c -- 60.7% of the
   gesture square reads exactly 1.0 (on a 1001 x 1001 grid of probes),
   including the middle of the demonstrated space; it reports the same value
   for "between your four takes" and "ten times outside them". With
   twenty-five demonstrations on a 5 x 5 grid it never exceeds 0.5, reached at
   the centre of each cell. The usable range of the control therefore depends
   on how many takes you recorded, and two instruments are not comparable.

   Making the scale relative to the demonstrations' own spacing would fix
   that, and would change what every sketch that maps novelty hears, so the
   scale stays as it is and this note says what it means.

   This costs one pass over the demonstrations. But it lets the instrument
   know when it is improvising rather than recalling, which you can map to
   anything you like: noise, detuning, a light.

   THE RANGES are the ones the neighbour functions measure in (PART 10): the
   instrument's own once it has been fitted, and on an instrument that has
   never been fitted the ranges of the demonstrations it holds, fitted on
   every call. That fitting is the one thing iris_novelty writes, and why it
   takes a non-const instrument. Without it, an instrument that has only been
   shown takes would measure in the 0..1 ranges iris_init starts with, which
   describe nothing it was shown: with one input demonstrated at 0 and 1000,
   a reading of 10 would read 1 before the first training run and 0.04 after
   it; it reads 0.04 in both.

   A reading that is not finite reads as 1, as far from home as it gets, and
   is answered before any fitting, so then iris_novelty writes nothing, the
   status included. An empty store reads 1 as well.

   It refuses with -1, rule 2 of the failure rules above iris_get_status, for
   a null instrument and for a shape too big for this translation unit's
   working arrays (iris_internal_shape_fits). A distance is never negative,
   so a refusal cannot be mistaken for 0, a reading exactly on a take.

   PART 8 — TRAINING  (backpropagation)

   The one idea in this file that needs explaining, and it is one idea:

     Run a demonstration forward. Compare what came out with what you
     demonstrated. Nudge every weight a little in whichever direction would
     have made that gap smaller. Repeat.

   "Which direction" is calculus: for each weight, how much the squared miss
   would change if that weight changed a little, which is its gradient. For
   a weight into an output unit that is the miss, times the slope of the
   sigmoid at that output, times the hidden value feeding the weight.
   "Backpropagation" is just the bookkeeping for the middle layer: a hidden
   unit has no target of its own, so its share of the blame is the output
   misses passed back through the weights that connect them, times the slope
   of its own tanh. Every weight then steps against its gradient, scaled by
   the learning rate, 0.10. Doing that after every single demonstration, in
   a shuffled order, is stochastic gradient descent.

   Two details that matter in practice:

   MOMENTUM. Instead of stepping purely downhill each time, keep a running
   velocity: each step is 0.85 of the previous step plus the new nudge.
   Steps in a consistent direction build up; steps that jitter back and
   forth cancel. On 20 demonstrations of a smooth 2-input, 3-output target it
   reaches a mean squared error of 1e-4 in 2,000 to 4,500 epochs, where the
   same run without momentum takes 8,700 to 28,000 (8 seeds): about five
   times fewer epochs, for one extra array.

   SHUFFLING. Present the demonstrations in a different order every epoch.
   A fixed order lets the network learn the order instead of the mapping: the
   last demonstration seen always gets the final say.
   ========================================================================== */

/* Guard sweep, run once per epoch: a not-a-number or infinity in any weight
   (or in the epoch's error) means the numbers are gone, so report it and
   recover to a finite state (iris_internal_trap_nan, below); a weight past
   IRIS_W_LIMIT means a divergence in progress, so clamp it, report and
   stop. It costs one pass over the
   weights per EPOCH, where backpropagation passes over them once per

   iris_train does not ask you for an epoch count. It runs until the
   training error PLATEAUS: every IRIS_CONV_WINDOW epochs it compares the
   error with the error one window earlier, and stops when the window bought
   less than IRIS_CONV_TOL of it. A short window (200-500 epochs) mistakes the
   ordinary epoch-to-epoch jitter of a shuffled run for a plateau and stops
   early (docs/adr/0017-train-to-the-plateau-not-to-a-constant.md
   records that measurement).

   WHAT THE PLATEAU BUYS: RECALL. On the reference task of tests/audit.c (20
   demonstrations, 2 inputs, 12 hidden units, 3 outputs), 600 epochs recall
   the demonstrations to a root-mean-square miss of 0.0066 and the plateau
   run, 18,000 epochs, to 0.0012, 5.5 times closer. On six synthetic target
   shapes with clean demonstrations the gain is 8.4, 4.2 and 2.8 times at
   10, 20 and 50 demonstrations.

   WHAT IT COSTS. Recall is not generalisation. On the same clean shapes the
   plateau also improves held-out error against 600 epochs, but by much less
   (7%, 7% and 19%). On noisy demonstrations a plateau run at smoothing 0
   fits the noise: it is 1.2 to 2.2 times worse on held-out error than
   stopping after a fixed 100 epochs (the table at iris_set_smoothing, where
   smoothing is the repair). Running on longer is worse still: a fixed
   60,000 epochs is 2% to 29% worse than the plateau under noise. None of
   this has been checked on recorded human gesture. Treat the ceiling as a
   ceiling, and smoothing as the knob for noisy takes.

   PROGRESS THAT DOES NOT LIE. A plateau run takes seconds on a board, long
   enough that a screen should show something true. Two ways in:

     - iris_train_begin / iris_train_slice / iris_train_progress run the SAME
       training as iris_train in slices, so a single-threaded sketch can draw
       a frame, read a touch and keep sound going between them. A sliced run
       is bit-identical to iris_train: iris_train_begin checks and reseeds
       exactly as iris_train does, the shuffle buffer is filled once there and
       carried across slices, and so the random draws are the same draws in
       the same order.
     - iris_continue_to_plateau(k, ceiling, cb, user), one of the warm
       trainers below, calls cb every window with (done, ceiling, err);
       returning 0 from cb ends the run, leaving a usable, partly trained
       instrument.

   iris_continue IS THE FIXED-EPOCH PATH: exactly the per-demonstration
   update of Weka's MultilayerPerceptron, the network Wekinator ships, with a
   fixed epoch count. tests/audit.c pins its output to the bit.

/* THE CEILING HAS TO FIT THE MACHINE'S int, BECAUSE IT IS PASSED AS ONE.

   iris_train, iris_train_begin and iris_continue_to_plateau hand it to
   iris_internal_train_run as an int epoch count. Where int is 16 bits, every
   Arduino AVR board, 60000 would become -5536 (avr-gcc for the atmega328p),
   the trainer's `epochs <= 0` guard would refuse, iris_train would return 0,
   and a sketch that ignored the return value would play an instrument that
   was never fitted.

   30000 is the largest round number that fits a signed 16-bit int. It is not a
   compromise in practice: an 8-bit AVR at 16 MHz does not reach 30,000 epochs
   in a time anyone will wait for, so the ceiling is not the binding constraint
   there -- being positive is. */

/* CAN THIS STORE BE TRAINED ON? Every trainer and diagnostic asks this
   FIRST, before it reseeds, fits ranges or touches a progress counter. So a
   refusal leaves the instrument as it was, and it goes on playing exactly as
   before.

   Three conditions. The shape fits this translation unit's working arrays
   (iris_internal_shape_fits). There is at least one demonstration. And every
   stored number is finite: a not-a-number would poison every weight in the
   first epoch.

   THE ONE WRITE. A shape that does not fit, or an empty store, is a mistake
   in how the call was made, and like every argument mistake it is reported
   by the return value alone (see the failure rules above iris_get_status). A
   stored number that is not finite is a matter of numerical health, which is
   what the status reports, so that refusal sets IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED -- and
   writes nothing else.

   iris_record and iris_load both refuse a non-finite number at the door, so
   this test is defence in depth, for a store that got one another way: a
   translation unit built with -DIRIS_NO_GUARDS recording into the same
   instrument, or a program writing into the store directly. The bad
   demonstration stays in the store where the musician can find it and
   delete it. The finiteness test is one of the guards, so a -DIRIS_NO_GUARDS
   build compiles it out, as it does iris_record's, and then nothing stops a
   not-a-number reaching the weights. */

   with the weights as they are now. Every trainer that fits calls it once
   when it finishes, and iris_load calls it, so the same weights and
   demonstrations give the same bits whichever way the instrument got them.
   The squares are added in one running sum, demonstration by demonstration
   and output by output, and divided once.

   It is not the figure the plateau test reads. That one (tr_err) is added up
   during an epoch while every visit moves the weights, so it describes no

  /* THE DIVERGENCE TRAP, AND WHY THIS REFUSAL EXISTS.
     When a run diverges, iris_internal_check_weights clamps the offending
     weights to exactly ±IRIS_W_LIMIT and stops. A run that continues from
     those weights starts with them sitting on the clamp: epoch 1 pushes one of
     them past, the guard fires again, and training stops after a single epoch.
     Measured on the demonstrations of examples/02_fix_a_mistake.c: 14 good
     ones plus one contradictory take diverge and pin ONE weight of 60.
     Without this refusal, a warm run after the bad take is deleted does
     exactly 1 epoch per call, diverges again on it, and returns an
     ordinary-looking error each time, while the first output creeps 0.087,
     0.091, 0.106 over three calls against the 0.618 it played before the take.
     Zeroing the momentum does not help -- it is the pinned weight, not the
     velocity.

     The demonstrations are fine; the WEIGHTS are damaged. Refitting from the
     seed recovers the instrument: on the same demonstrations iris_train plays
     0.618 again, exactly what it played before the damage. So a run that
     would continue from pinned weights refuses, loudly and distinguishably,
     with IRIS_DIVERGED_STUCK, rather than pretending to train. It does NOT
     reseed on its own: a warm trainer is asked to keep the performer's
     weights, and replacing them silently would hand the performer a
     different instrument, the loss of accumulated technique that Fiebrink
     and Sonami describe (NIME 2020; see the warm trainers below).

     THE WEIGHTS DECIDE, NOT THE STATUS (iris_internal_pinned). So the refusal
     holds on every call for as long as a weight sits on the limit: a refusal
     moves no weight, so the next call refuses too, and a status overwritten by
     an unrelated call -- a not-a-number refused at iris_record's door, say --
     cannot let a warm run through. The way out is a run that does not continue
     from these weights: iris_train and iris_train_begin reseed from the
     instrument's own seed before their first epoch, so they never meet this
     test with pinned weights.

     Every entry reaches this test, slices included, but a sliced run starts
     from iris_train_begin's reseed and ends itself if it diverges, so in
     practice what it refuses are the warm trainers, iris_continue and
     iris_continue_to_plateau. The one write is the status, plus ending the
     run if a slice is refused. */

         d_out = (predicted - target) * y*(1-y). y*(1-y) is the exact
         derivative of the TRUE logistic. This forward pass does not use the
         true logistic: iris_internal_sigmoid is built from iris_internal_tanh,
         the clamped rational of PART 1. So the backward pass is not the
         derivative of the forward pass. It is a surrogate, close enough in
         shape to point downhill.

         HOW FAR OFF. Exact only at zero, and under-scaled by up to 2 times
         across the ordinary operating range (docs/MATH-AUDIT.md, section 5,
         tabulates the ratio for the rational without its clamp, where it
         also changes sign). The shipped function does not change sign: the
         clamp holds a inside [-1, +1], so 1-a*a is never negative. Checked
         over 66,368,438 finite float bit patterns: 0 negatives, where the
         same check on the unclamped form finds 3,970,919 of 16,527,549.

         WHY IT STAYS. The textbook objection is that y*(1-y) collapses the
         gradient exactly when a unit is confidently wrong. Instrumented for
         that event, it fired ZERO times in 48.96 million output-unit
         updates, and it cannot at the defaults: targets live in [0.1, 0.9],
         so y*(1-y) >= 0.09 whenever the network is near its target. It does
         happen above a learning rate of 0.5, which only the internal setter
         reaches. Every repair tried measured worse (docs/MATH-FIXES.md,
         defect 3), and the exact derivative of the rational makes no
         measurable difference (PART 1).

         WHAT IS TRADED AWAY. One alternative does beat this: a cross-entropy
         gradient (the gradient of the logarithmic loss usually paired with a
         sigmoid output, which is the miss alone, with no y*(1-y) factor)
         with the targets left in [0.1, 0.9] wins 32 of 32 seeds at
         20 demonstrations by about 5%, and about 12% at a tuned learning
         rate. It loses at 10 demonstrations (1.094 times worse), the regime a
         musician actually demonstrates in, and it widens the reroll spread in
         the undemonstrated gaps by 1.6 times. A reroll that changes the
         instrument is one of this library's promises, and y*(1-y) is the
         brake that keeps it steady at the demonstrations. That is a judgement

         WEIGHT DECAY, when asked for. In full, per weight and per
         demonstration visited:
             v = momentum * v - lr * gradient      (flushed)
             w = w + v

         with wd = l2 * lr / n_ex, where l2 is 0.3 times the smoothing
         setting. So the decay is taken after the velocity step, from the
         weight that step produced, and it is scaled by the learning rate as
         the gradient step is. `wd` is zero unless iris_set_smoothing set it,
         and at zero `w[h] - 0.0f * w[h]` subtracts an exact zero, so the
         update is the undecayed one bit for bit; the default path pays one
         multiply and one subtraction per weight for it.

         The decayed weight is flushed like the velocities (IRIS_FLUSH). A
         weight with no gradient -- one from an input that never moved, say
         -- only shrinks, by the same fraction on every visit, and without the
         flush it would pass through the subnormal numbers on its way to
         zero, where a processor that flushes them and one that does not
         part ways (see IRIS_TINY). Six demonstrations with one still input
         at smoothing 1 (the check in tests/train.c) have a weight below
         IRIS_TINY after 2,225 epochs and a subnormal one after 2,832 without
         the flush, and every such weight at exactly zero after 2,285 with it.
         A weight smaller than IRIS_TINY moves nothing, so zero loses
         nothing, and no healthy run at smoothing 0 has one: the golden hash
         does not move.

         Decoupled (applied to the weight, not folded into the gradient, so it
         does not build up in the momentum) and on WEIGHTS ONLY. Biases are
         never decayed: penalising a bias shifts the function without
         reducing its freedom, which is cost with no benefit. Scaled by 1/n_ex

    /* THE ERROR FLOOR — a fourth stopping rule, and at small demonstration
       counts the one most likely to be what actually stopped you.

       WHAT 1e-6 IS. `tr_err` is the mean squared error over every
       demonstration and output, in the network's own output units, where
       each output's demonstrated range spans the 0.8-wide band [0.1, 0.9],
       added up during the epoch while the weights are still moving (not
       iris_last_error, which is measured after the run). So the floor is
       a root-mean-square miss of 0.001 in those units: 0.125% of each
       output's demonstrated range. It is ABSOLUTE -- the same number whatever
       the data, the noise or the number of demonstrations -- and it was
       chosen as "close enough to a perfect fit", not derived from anything.

       WHEN IT FIRES. A network with a few dozen weights can fit a handful of
       demonstrations exactly, noise and all, so with few takes the error
       falls through the floor before the plateau test ever looks. iris_train
       on 2 inputs -> 12 hidden -> 3 outputs, six synthetic target shapes x 40
       seeds per cell (240 runs), stopped here in:
           demonstrations       4     5     8    10    12    20    50

       Every other run stopped on the plateau test, except 57 of the 5,040
       that the divergence guard stopped and 1 that reached the ceiling.

       It sits outside the `conv` guard on purpose (a perfect fit is a reason
       to stop on any path), so it also fires on the fixed-epoch path. Ask
       iris_train_epochs_done() how many epochs actually ran; if it is below

   THE WARM TRAINERS: iris_continue AND iris_continue_to_plateau

   Both carry on from the weights the instrument holds now, with the momentum
   and the random state where the last run left them. iris_train, below, is
   the second of them run from a fresh start: it reseeds from the
   instrument's own seed and then calls iris_continue_to_plateau.

   EVERY CALL IS A SESSION OF ITS OWN. A blocking call starts its shuffle
   from the identity order (iris_internal_begin_session), whatever order the
   last run left; only a sliced run carries its order from one slice to the
   next. So n calls of iris_continue(k, 1) are not iris_continue(k, n): the
   same random draws permute a different starting order. On the golden
   recipe of tests/audit.c, 800 one-epoch calls end with weights up to 0.0182
   away from one 800-epoch call.

   WHY THEY EXIST. A musician who has practised an instrument and records
   one more take wants that corner fixed without the rest of the mapping
   moving. Retraining from the seed rewrites the mapping everywhere, which
   is how musicians lose accumulated technique to retraining (Fiebrink and
   Sonami, NIME 2020). A short warm run starts from the practised weights
   instead. The tests/audit.c check "correction: parity fit, surgical
   drift" adds one take to a practised 20-take instrument and runs
   iris_continue(k, 20): the training root-mean-square
   error reaches 0.0187, against 0.0181 for a cold 600-epoch retrain from
   the same seed, on a thirtieth of the epochs, and the mapping far from the
   new take moves 0.0025 on average, against 0.0033 for the retrain.

   THE HAZARD. The weights remember every demonstration they were trained
   on, including one you have since deleted: a deleted bad take's influence
   survives in the weights, and a warm run starts from exactly those
   weights, so continuing after a delete does not undo the take. On 20
   demonstrations of a smooth target plus one contradictory take, trained,
   the take deleted, then trained again: continuing leaves the instrument 14
   times further from the true mapping than iris_train does (mean error
   0.1416 against 0.0100, 40 of 40 seeds, every one with a healthy status),
   and when the deleted take sat between demonstrations it leaves the
   mapping there 0.75 to 0.82 of full scale wrong (8 of 8 seeds). A take
   outside the demonstrated range does damage of its own, because every run
   refits the ranges: correcting at twice the range moves the whole mapping
   by 0.07 to 0.16, against about 0.0015 for a take inside it. (These
   figures come from studies whose programs are not in this repository.)
   After deleting a take, call iris_train, which starts over from the seed
   and fits only the demonstrations stored now.

   THE SEED ALONE NO LONGER DESCRIBES THE INSTRUMENT. A warm run draws its
   shuffle from the random state the last run left, so after one the seed
   reproduces only a fresh iris_train; replaying the same records, deletes
   and runs in the same order reproduces the instrument to the bit (the
   tests/audit.c check "event-sourced determinism"). A saved file carries
   the random state (PART 9) but not the momentum velocities, which a load
   sets to zero, so a warm run after a load matches the same run on the
   unsaved instrument only when its velocities were zero as well, and then
   it matches to the bit (the check "save round trip carries the random
   state").

   Both refuse (-1) what every trainer refuses (iris_internal_trainable),
   and while a weight sits exactly on ±IRIS_W_LIMIT they refuse with
   IRIS_DIVERGED_STUCK on every call, that status being the one thing they
   write; iris_train is the way out. A run that meets a not-a-number
   partway also returns -1, but that one has changed the instrument: it is
   back at its seed's starting weights, unfitted, with IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED (see
   iris_internal_trap_nan and the failure rules above iris_get_status).
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/* THE FIXED-EPOCH TRAINER: exactly `epochs` more epochs from the current
   weights, fewer only if the error floor or the divergence guard stops the
   run (iris_train_epochs_done says how many ran). Returns the training
   error of the weights it leaves, the value iris_last_error then reports,
   or -1 if it refused, which it also does for a budget of zero or less, or
   if it met a not-a-number partway, which leaves the instrument at its
   seed's unfitted start (iris_internal_trap_nan). Mind THE HAZARD above:
   after deleting a take, call iris_train, not this.

   It matches Weka MultilayerPerceptron's per-weight update recursion and its
   per-demonstration update granularity.

   WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM. The recursion is an exact algebraic
   rewrite of Weka's (ours: v = momentum*v - lr*g*x, w += v; theirs:
   delta = lr*err*x + momentum*delta_prev, w += delta — same formula, opposite
   sign convention, both starting at zero). The granularity matches: n_ex
   weight writes per epoch, not one.

   It is NOT numerically identical to Weka and cannot be. iris computes in
   binary32; Weka computes in binary64 at every step, so exact agreement is
   impossible in principle, not merely unachieved. Nor is it identical in
   behaviour: iris's hidden units use the rational of PART 1 where Weka's
   use the logistic, its outputs are a sigmoid then a clamp where Weka's are
   linear and unclamped, its learning rate and momentum are 0.10 and 0.85
   where Weka's are 0.3 and 0.2, and it reshuffles every epoch where Weka
   shuffles once. Same rule, different quantities entering it, therefore
   different trajectories.

   Every "bit-identical" claim in this file is a claim about THIS FILE's
   self-consistency (sliced against unsliced runs, save and load round
   trips, -O0 against -O3), never about Weka. The golden hash in
   tests/audit.c pins the weights this produces, so any change to it is a
   change to training, made deliberately with the hash re-pinned and a

   error stops improving. No epoch count to guess, no callback, no ceiling.

   WHEN IT STOPS. Whichever of these comes first:
     - the plateau test: every IRIS_CONV_WINDOW (2,000) epochs it compares the
       error with the error one window earlier, and stops when the window
       bought less than IRIS_CONV_TOL (10%) of it;
     - the ceiling, IRIS_CONV_CEILING (60,000 epochs; 30,000 where int is 16
       bits);
     - the error floor, see the note at `tr_err < 1e-6f` in the engine: an
       ABSOLUTE floor on the epoch's mean squared error, not a relative one,
       and at small demonstration counts it, not the plateau test, is
       usually what stops the run;
     - the divergence guard: a weight past ±IRIS_W_LIMIT is clamped and the
       run ends there with status IRIS_TRAINING_DIVERGED.
   iris_train_epochs_done tells you how many epochs actually ran.

   Returns 1 if it fitted, 0 if it refused. It refuses when there are no
   demonstrations, when the instrument is null, or when its shape is too big
   for this translation unit's working arrays, and then changes nothing at
   all; and it refuses when a demonstration holds a not-a-number or an
   infinity, and then the one thing it changes is the status, to
   IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED. Neither refusal touches the weights or the ranges. A run
   the divergence guard stopped still returns 1: the instrument was fitted,
   and the status says how. It also returns 0, with IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED, when it
   meets a not-a-number partway through a run (demonstrations spread wider
   than a float can span), which leaves the instrument reseeded and
   unfitted. If you want to know HOW WELL it fits, that is a separate
   question with a separate answer: iris_last_error(k).

   IT NEVER REFUSES A STUCK INSTRUMENT, and that is deliberate: starting over
   from the seed is the way out of IRIS_DIVERGED_STUCK, whose weights are the

     stopping sooner it is the wrong one (a fixed 100 epochs beats it by 1.2
     to 2.2 times at noise 0.05 and above, unless smoothing is on): see
     TRAINING TO A PLATEAU above, and the table at iris_set_smoothing.

     On clean demonstrations it can stop far too early. One input, 12 hidden
     units, one output, twelve takes evenly spaced on a straight ramp from 0
     to 1, seed 1, then iris_continue up to each mark:

       epochs      training error   worst miss on a demonstrated take
       4,000       3.10e-04         0.0433    <- where this function stops

     (training error is iris_last_error; the floor reads the last epoch's
     own figure, which has just fallen under 1e-6.)

     The error sits on a FALSE plateau from epoch 4,000 past 160,000 and then
     falls two orders of magnitude (seeds 7, 42 and 12345 do the same; seed
     1234 stays on it until after 320,000). The plateau outlasts this
     library's maximum budget, so nothing here can see past it, and raising
     `ceiling` on iris_continue_to_plateau cannot help: a ceiling is a
     maximum, and the run stops far below it.

     If your demonstrations are clean and recall matters more to you than
     what happens between takes, the escape is iris_continue(k, 400000) after
     this. That is a real choice with a real cost, which is why it is

/* LEAVE-ONE-OUT CROSS-VALIDATION — a real held-out error, at a size where you
   can afford it.

   THE OBJECTION THIS ANSWERS. Everything else in this library measures itself
   against the demonstrations it was fitted on. Training stops when TRAINING
   error plateaus, which is not the same event as "it got as good as it is
   going to get at things it has not seen", and a machine-learning reviewer
   is right to say so. The usual remedy, holding back 20% as a validation
   set, is unavailable here: at 20 demonstrations that discards 4 of them, and
   you cannot spare 4.

   Leave-one-out is the remedy that fits this regime. Hide ONE demonstration,
   refit on the rest, and see how far off the hidden one you land. Do that
   once per demonstration and average. Nothing is discarded; every
   demonstration is used for training in every fold but its own.

   WHAT IT COSTS. n_ex + 1 fits of `epochs` each (600 by default): the folds,
   then the final refit. At 20 demonstrations of a 2-12-3 instrument that is
   about 21 ms on the development laptop (an Apple M4 Max, Apple clang -O2).
   It has not been timed on the ESP32-S3. It is a deliberate, occasional act,
   "how good is this actually?", not something to put in a play loop.

   HOW TO USE IT. For comparison, not as an absolute grade: run it at several
   smoothing values and take the lowest. That picks a setting without tuning
   on the very numbers you then report.

   HOW WELL THAT WORKS. Twenty demonstrations on a 5 x 4 grid of a smooth
   2-input, 3-output target, with Gaussian noise of standard deviation 0.05
   on the outputs, seed 1234. The left column is this function; the right is
   the mean squared error of the plateau-trained instrument against the clean
   target on a 21 x 21 grid:

       smoothing   leave-one-out    held-out truth
       0              0.00645          0.00213
       0.05           0.00555          0.00082   <- actually best
       0.15           0.00534          0.00084   <- leave-one-out's pick
       0.5            0.00692          0.00085
       1              0.00890          0.00164

   It ranks the ends correctly (no smoothing and full smoothing are both
   worse) and picks a neighbour of the true best, which here is nearly as
   good. That is the known behaviour of leave-one-out at small n: nearly
   unbiased but noisy, and each fold trains on n-1 demonstrations rather than
   n. It also scores 600-epoch fits, not the plateau run you play. Treat it
   as a coarse ranking: it tells you whether to smooth and roughly how much,
   not the exact optimum. Its absolute value is NOT comparable to a held-out
   error (the columns above differ by three to eight times), so use it only
   to compare settings with each other.

   Every fold trains from the SAME seed, so the folds differ only by which
   demonstration was hidden. epochs <= 0 takes 600. Returns mean squared error per
   output, in the demonstrations' own units, or -1 if it refused: fewer than 3
   demonstrations to fold over, or a store no trainer would accept (see
   iris_internal_trainable). It checks that BEFORE the first fold reseeds
   anything, so a refusal changes nothing but the status, which it sets to
   IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED only for a demonstration that is not finite, and it never
   returns a not-a-number.

   THE INSTRUMENT IS LEFT REFITTED ON ALL DEMONSTRATIONS, from that same
   seed, with iris_continue for `epochs`, so it is valid to play afterwards,
   but it is NOT the instrument you had before you called this: it has been
   retrained, and for a fixed 600 epochs rather than to the plateau. Save
   first, or call iris_train afterwards, if that matters. */

/* The sweep itself, shared by iris_loo_error and iris_suggest_smoothing.
   per_range = 0 sums each miss in the demonstrations' own units, which is
   what iris_loo_error reports. per_range = 1 first divides each output's miss
   by that output's demonstrated range across all n demonstrations, so no

/* SUGGEST A SMOOTHING VALUE: an explicit, occasional act, not an automatic one.

   Runs leave-one-out (above) at each of five smoothing settings -- 0, 0.05,
   0.15, 0.5 and 1 -- and returns the one that scored best, or -1 if it
   refused. IT DOES NOT APPLY IT. You get the number, you decide.

   WHAT IT SCORES IS A PROXY. Every fold is a fixed 600-epoch fit from the
   instrument's seed, NOT the plateau run iris_train makes and you then play:
   a plateau fit costs about 25 times more, averaging 14,000 to 15,600 epochs
   at 20 demonstrations over the runs behind the error-floor table in the
   engine (clean to noise sigma 0.10). The proxy has a price. Measured on 36
   datasets (six target shapes, three noise levels, two draws of 20
   demonstrations) with 8 rerolls each, against held-out error on a clean
   grid: the pick was the best of the five settings for the 600-epoch fit it
   scores 41% of the time, and for the plateau-trained instrument 35% of the
   time; following it cost a geometric-mean 6.6% over the best setting for
   the 600-epoch fit, and 16.2% for the plateau-trained instrument. So it is a
   noisy selector even for the model it scores, and the budget mismatch more
   than doubles what following it costs.

   UNITS DO NOT MATTER. Each output's miss on the hidden demonstration is
   divided by that output's demonstrated range before it is squared, so an
   output recorded in thousands counts the same as one recorded in
   fractions: "Units: none" from the interface block, applied here. iris_loo_error itself
   reports raw units. An output whose demonstrations never moved carries no
   evidence about smoothing and is left out.

   WHY IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC. Tried as an automatic default, on the same 36
   datasets with 16 rerolls each:

     - IT IS NOT STABLE. Rerolling the same demonstrations changed its answer:
       2.17 distinct values per dataset on average. An instrument whose
       smoothing changes when you reroll is an instrument that stops being
       predictable, which is worse than one that is merely unsmoothed.
     - IT IS SOMETIMES WORSE THAN DOING NOTHING. 10.9% of its picks gave the
       plateau-trained instrument a worse held-out error than smoothing 0.
     - IT IS SLOW. Five sweeps of n + 1 fits: 104 ms at 20 demonstrations and
       640 ms at 50 on the development laptop (an Apple M4 Max; 2 inputs, 12
       hidden units, 3 outputs). It has not been timed on the ESP32-S3. At
       the 32 to 40 microseconds per demonstration per epoch that
       device_torture's test 5 implies (a board figure awaiting a recorded
       log), the 1.2 million demonstration-epochs of a 20-demonstration
       suggestion would take 40 to 50 seconds: an estimate, not a board
       reading. That is not something to hide inside a training call.

   WHAT IT IS GOOD FOR: a starting point when you genuinely do not know, on a
   machine where 100 ms is nothing. It captured 81% of what always picking
   the best setting would have gained. Treat the number as a suggestion to
   audition, not an answer — and if you like where you land, pin it in your
   code rather than re-deriving it, so your instrument stays put.

   ASKING FOR ADVICE MUST NOT COST YOU YOUR INSTRUMENT. Every fold refits the
   network, so before the first one this copies every byte the instrument
   owns -- weights, momentum velocities, ranges, demonstrations, the residual
   ledger, the random state, the progress counters, the status, `fitted` and
   `trained` -- into your scratch, and copies it all back afterwards. A stale
   instrument that is still playing goes on playing, and a warm trainer
   called afterwards continues exactly as it would have. The arena is exactly
   sized and has nowhere to keep that copy, hence the scratch: give it at
   least IRIS_ARENA(n_in, n_hid, n_out, cap) bytes -- the size of the
   instrument's own arena, which iris_size returns at run time -- at any
   alignment, not overlapping the instrument. It refuses otherwise, and on
   anything iris_loo_error refuses, having changed nothing but, for a
   demonstration that is not finite, the status: refusing an answer is
   recoverable, and quietly replacing someone's instrument is not. A
   mistake in the arguments is found before the store is looked at, so it
   leaves the status alone even when a demonstration is poisoned too.

/* ==========================================================================
   PART 8f — WHICH DEMONSTRATION IS FIGHTING THE OTHERS

   The trial-and-error trap in interactive machine learning is that when the
   instrument
   feels wrong you have no idea WHICH of your twenty demonstrations is
   wrong, so you re-record at random. This points at one.

   IT IS THE INTEGRAL, NOT THE ENDPOINT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE IDEA.
   The obvious detector is the final training residual: after training, ask
   each demonstration how badly the network still misses it. It gets WORSE as the
   mistake gets bigger, because given enough epochs the optimiser bends the
   surface far enough to fit the bad point too, after which it looks like
   every other point. So this sums each demonstration's squared error over
   EVERY epoch instead, which measures how long it fought rather than where
   it ended up. A demonstration that agrees with its neighbours is fitted
   early and
   stays fitted; one that contradicts them stays wrong for thousands of
   epochs. That ranking is stable across training budgets where the endpoint
   is not.

   WHAT YOU GET BACK IS A MARGIN, NOT A LEVEL, and that is deliberate. The
   worst-of-n stress score rises with n on clean data with nothing wrong at
   all, so a screen wired to a fixed level would be silent on small
   instruments and cry wolf on large ones. Worst divided by second-worst
   does not drift. IRIS_STRESS_FLAG is 2.5.

   BELOW IRIS_STRESS_MIN_EX (12) IT RETURNS -1 AND SAYS NOTHING. A
   demonstration can only be caught disagreeing with a crowd if there is a
   crowd; at ten demonstrations the clean margin alone reaches 5.04
   (docs/adr/0019-the-residual-ledger-integrates-it-does-not-sample.md),
   which would be a false accusation.

   THE LIMIT THAT TRAVELS WITH IT. Every number below comes from one clean
   offset on one output of a smooth, noiseless truth. A 5% offset of that kind
   is smaller than the spread between two takes of the same human gesture,
   and on clean synthetic sessions iris_train still ranks it first (18 of 20,
   below), but real demonstrations are inconsistent in ways that are not one
   displaced output, and none of this has been checked against a recorded
   human gesture.

   THE FLAG IS NOT SILENT ON CLEAN SESSIONS, AND IT CAN MISS. Measured with
   `tests/elm.c measure` on the protocol of the note named below (12 hidden
   units, 8 outputs, 200 clean sessions at each of 20, 50 and 100
   demonstrations): after iris_train the largest clean margin is 3.23, 4.05
   and 3.22, and 7, 15 and 6 of the 200 reach IRIS_STRESS_FLAG; after the
   closed-form trainer, whose ledger is the miss that remains after its solve
   (PART 8d), 25, 14 and 24 of 200 reach it, the largest 9.99. With one
   output of one take offset by 0.05 to 0.40, iris_train ranks that take
   first in 18 to 20 of 20 sessions, the closed-form ledger in 13 to 20 of 20
   (13 to 15 at 20 demonstrations). So a flag is a take to listen to again,
   not a take to delete unheard, and no flag does not prove every take is
   good. A candidate improvement for the closed-form trainer, not built: the
   leave-one-out residual, each demonstration's miss divided by one minus its
   leverage, which is how strongly that demonstration pulls the fit toward
   itself (its diagonal entry of the hat matrix, the matrix that turns the
   demonstrated targets into the fitted ones). The same Cholesky factor
   gives it in about n times (nh+1) squared operations.

   COST. sizeof(float) * cap in the arena (512 bytes at cap 128, 1 KB at
   cap 256) and one float addition per demonstration per epoch, a sliver of
   the backpropagation work already being done for it.

   method from the machine-learning literature that credits each training
   example with its gradient's effect summed over training):

   PART 8d — THE CLOSED-FORM TRAINER  (ELM: freeze the randomness, solve the rest)

   The fastest trainer in this file. On the development laptop, at 50
   demonstrations, two inputs and nh = 12 (12 hidden units), a solve takes
   about 8 microseconds where 600 epochs of backpropagation take 2.6 ms,
   roughly 300 times longer (tests/audit.c prints both in its training-cost
   table). It has not been timed on the ESP32-S3. The ratio shrinks as
   inputs are added, because the frozen layer is redrawn for every
   demonstration (see NOTHING CHANGES UNLESS THE SOLVE WORKS, below).

   The trick is to stop training half the network. Draw the hidden layer
   once from the seed and FREEZE it. Each demonstration then gives the
   hidden units' answers h (plus a constant 1 for the bias) and a target z
   for each output (the demonstrated output, mapped back through the
   sigmoid). The output weights beta that fit best in the least-squares
   sense solve the linear system

       (H^T H + ridge) beta = H^T z

   where H stacks one row of h per demonstration. H^T H is the normal
   matrix, (nh+1) x (nh+1), and one Cholesky factorisation solves it: no
   epochs, no iteration. This idea has a name in the literature, extreme
   learning machine, and a 20-year argument about whether it deserves one;
   it is here because it works here.

   Two measurements make it work in single precision on this network:

   GAIN. The backprop starting weights (1/sqrt(n_in)) rely on training to grow.
   Frozen at that scale, tanh of a normalised input barely bends -- the random
   features are nearly collinear and the normal matrix is numerically
   rank-deficient. The frozen layer is drawn at 2/sqrt(n_in) instead, wide
   enough that the features have real capacity. docs/gain-sweep.c measures the
   choice in one command: mean held-out error over 4 target shapes x 16 seeds x
   {8,20,50} demonstrations x nh {12,24,48}, gain = M/sqrt(n_in):

       M         0.25   0.50   1.00   1.50   2.00   3.00   4.00   8.00
       error    .1143  .1025  .0946  .0919  .0905  .0894  .0920  .1087

   M=2 beats the backpropagation starting scale, M=1, by 4.3%. The minimum
   is BROAD and M=2 sits inside it. M=3 is marginally better (1.2%) and the
   optimum drifts upward with width (best at 1.5 for nh=12 and at 3.0 for
   nh=48), so 2 is a good constant rather than the best one. It stays because
   a 1.2% gain on synthetic targets does not justify a change to training,
   which would re-pin the closed-form hashes in tests/elm.c.

   RIDGE, MANDATORY. Even with the wider gain, the unridged float32 normal
   matrix fails Cholesky in EVERY realistic scenario measured, including 20
   well-spread demonstrations. The ridge is relative (lam0 * trace/(nh+1), so it
   scales with the data) plus a floor of 1e-7, and it escalates
   deterministically: double it on a failed factorisation, at most 8 times, and
   report the count. If escalation was needed the status says
   IRIS_RIDGE_ESCALATED -- the result is valid, the data was harder than usual.
   The measurements: docs/adr/0009-ridge-is-mandatory.md. Escalation
   can still run out: lam0 = 0 on 128 demonstrations all made at one gesture
   fails all nine attempts (40 seeds of 40, at 8, 12 and 24 hidden units), and
   that is an ordinary refusal (below).

   SMOOTHING reaches this trainer as extra ridge on the output weights, and
   never on the output biases: a penalised bias drags every output toward the
   middle of its range, where an unpenalised one lets heavy smoothing settle
   near the average of what was demonstrated (averaged in logit units: the
   logit is the inverse of the sigmoid, the space the solve works in).
   Smoothing s is stored as weight decay 0.3 s (PART 3); the solve adds four
   times that, 1.2 s, to the diagonal entry of every output weight, on top of
   the relative ridge above. At smoothing 0 the added term is exactly zero, so
   the solve is bit-for-bit the unsmoothed one. The extra ridge is absolute,
   not relative to the data: like backprop's weight decay, its pull stays
   fixed while the evidence grows with every demonstration, so smoothing
   matters most with few takes.

   THE FOUR IS MEASURED, NOT DERIVED. Carrying backprop's weight decay into
   logit units at the sigmoid's steepest slope (0.25) gives sixteen. With
   sixteen, the best setting for noisy demonstrations sat between 0.05 and 0.2
   and smoothing 1 cost clean demonstrations 25% at 20 takes; with four, the
   best setting sits between 0.1 and 1 and smoothing 1 costs clean ones 8%.
   The table is `tests/elm.c measure` (the figures for sixteen come from the
   same program with the constant edited): nh 12, lam0 1e-4, 4 target shapes
   x 16 seeds, outputs spanning about 0..1. Each cell is two root-mean-square
   errors: at the demonstrations, then on fresh points against the clean
   target.

       demos noise   smoothing 0     0.1             0.3             1.0
         8   0.10    .0260 .2123     .0698 .1339     .0793 .1283     .0909 .1264

   Recall error rises at every step, which is what smoothing promises. On 8 or
   20 noisy demonstrations the held-out error at 0.3 falls by 10% to 40%, most
   with the fewest and noisiest takes; on 20 clean ones 0.3 costs nothing. On
   50, where least squares already averages the noise away, smoothing only
   adds bias: 0.3 costs 11% on lightly noisy takes and 17% on clean ones. The
   default stays 0, for the reason PART 3 gives.

   NOTHING CHANGES UNLESS THE SOLVE WORKS. Every refusal -- a bad argument, too
   little scratch, a poisoned demonstration, or a factorisation that fails even
   after escalation -- leaves every byte of the instrument as it was, and the
   return value is the report. The one exception is the poisoned
   demonstration, which sets the status to IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED, as every trainer
   does (see iris_internal_trainable). That takes some care,
   because a solve needs the new ranges and the new frozen layer before it can
   know whether it will succeed:
     - the solve works in the caller's scratch, never in the weight arrays;
     - the frozen layer is a pure function of the seed, so it is redrawn for
       each demonstration one hidden unit at a time rather than stored, and
       written into the instrument only once the solve has succeeded;
     - the ranges are fitted in place, because every normalisation in this
       file reads them from the instrument, and the old ones wait in scratch
       and are put back byte for byte if the solve fails.
   A solution containing a non-finite number is a failed solve too: it can only
   come from demonstrations so far apart that their span overflows a float.

   WHICH DEMONSTRATION IS FIGHTING (PART 8f). A solve has no epochs to sum
   over, so it leaves each demonstration's squared miss under the solve in the
   ledger, in the same normalised units, with res_epochs 1; whatever an earlier
   backprop run left there is replaced. PART 8f explains why the endpoint
   residual is worthless after backprop: given enough epochs the optimiser
   bends onto the bad take. The ridged solve has only nh+1 numbers per output
   to bend with, so the endpoint still carries the signal -- less of it than the
   integrated ledger does. `tests/elm.c measure`, on the protocol of
   docs/adr/0019-the-residual-ledger-integrates-it-does-not-sample.md (nh 12,
   8 outputs, one take offset on one output; hits of 20 sessions, and clean
   sessions whose margin reaches IRIS_STRESS_FLAG, of 200):

                       demos   +0.05   +0.10   +0.20   +0.40   clean >= flag

   So after this trainer the flag speaks on 7-13% of clean sessions, about
   twice as often as after backprop: treat a flagged take as one to listen to
   again, not one to delete unheard.

   The solved instrument is an ordinary iris instrument: same w1/b1/w2/b2
   arrays, same iris_predict, saves and loads as a normal file. Its output
   weights can lie beyond IRIS_W_LIMIT, which is legitimate here; the note at
   IRIS_W_LIMIT says what that means for gradient training afterwards. The
   solve targets logit space, the exact inverse of this file's sigmoid, so
   the forward pass lands on the normalised targets. That makes it a
   bounded-output VARIANT of the backpropagation network's output layer, not
   an equivalent. docs/adr/0008-elm-same-network-better-math.md compares it
   with a solve whose outputs are linear; nothing in this repository bounds
   the difference between the closed-form fit and a backpropagation fit.

   REROLL is the reason to love it: a new seed literally IS a new frozen
   random layer, undiluted by any training, steady at the demonstrations and
   lively in the gaps (the tests/audit.c check "ELM: same seed, same bits;
   reroll character" measures the demonstrations moving 0.0106 between
   seeds and the gaps 0.1123). iris_reseed(k, new_seed) then iris_train_elm
   is the whole gesture: the purest form of "same demonstrations, different
   instrument" this library has. That needs nh >= 8, since four frozen
   random features cannot recall five demonstrations, so this trainer
   refuses a narrower instrument outright. Numbers and the recommended lam0
   per width: docs/adr/0008-elm-same-network-better-math.md.

   Determinism: the hidden layer is drawn from k->seed by a LOCAL random number
   generator (k->rng is never touched, so a solve does not move the random
   state a warm trainer draws from), accumulation order is fixed by
   demonstration order, and the escalation schedule is fixed. Same seed and
   same demonstrations give bit-identical weights (checked at nh 12, 24 and
   48 in tests/audit.c).

       maps every gesture to the same sound. That is not a failed solve by any
       numerical test: no value is bad and the ridge did what it was asked.
       So ask the only question that matters to a musician: do the gestures
       they demonstrated still sound different? Everything is compared in
       normalised units, so the answer does not depend on the caller's units.

       Only ask when there was a mapping to learn: some input moved AND some
       output changed across the demonstrations. When every demonstration
       carried the same sound, or every take was made at the same gesture, a
       constant is the right answer, and flagging it would report correct
       behaviour as a fault. Both questions are asked of the demonstrations
       themselves, not of the ranges, which iris_internal_fit_ranges widens for
       a constant output. An input that never moved reads 0 in every
       demonstration (PART 5), so it never counts as moving, and an instrument
       whose inputs all stood still is never reported.

       Collapsed means: on every output the demonstrations changed, the fitted
       outputs move less than half a percent as far as the demonstrations did
       -- a constant with rounding on it. The status says IRIS_SOLVE_COLLAPSED,
       a report of its own: the solve is still installed, a smaller lam0, or a

   PART 9 — SAVING

   A trained instrument has to be a thing you can put somewhere and get back.
   The file carries the weights AND the demonstrations, so whoever receives it
   can keep working rather than inheriting a sealed box.

   THE FILE, format version 7. Every number is little-endian (least
   significant byte first) and is written and read one byte at a time, so a
   file means the same thing on every machine and the buffer you hand over
   needs no particular alignment. A float travels as its binary32 bit
   pattern. In the type column, u32 is an unsigned 32-bit integer, i32 a
   signed one, and f32 a float. Format 7 is the first format this library
   promises to keep reading in every later release (README.md, "What is
   promised").

      end-4  checksum of every byte before it     u32      exact
             (CRC-32, see iris_internal_crc32)

   And the length: exactly what the header says, not a byte more or less.

   WHAT THE RULES ARE FOR. The checksum catches accidents -- a flipped bit in
   flash, a write cut off by a power failure -- but anyone can recompute it,
   so a file written by a buggy program, or edited by hand, arrives with a
   good checksum and whatever it happens to contain. The rules catch that
   second kind. Each one refuses a value that would go wrong later if it were
   let in:

     - The shape must match because the weights only mean something at the size
       they were trained at. iris_internal_shape_fits is asked too, because the
       loader's own working array is sized by this translation unit's
       IRIS_MAX_IN (see the note above iris_internal_shape_fits).
     - Unsigned throughout: a count with its top bit set is a large number
       that fails "at most the capacity", not a negative one that passes it.
     - next_id stays below IRIS_ID_LIMIT -- 2^31 - 1, the largest int32_t,
       where int has 32 bits, and 32,767 where it has 16 -- so a loaded
       instrument has at least one identifier left to hand out, and every
       identifier fits the int the functions return it as. iris_record hands
       out next_id and adds one, and refuses once next_id reaches the limit,
       so the count never overflows. The limit belongs to the receiving
       machine, like the capacity: the bytes mean the same everywhere.
     - A weight need only be finite. IRIS_W_LIMIT is backpropagation's
       detector for a runaway run, not a rule about valid instruments: the
       closed-form trainer (PART 8d) legitimately solves output weights beyond
       it (see the note at IRIS_W_LIMIT).
     - An input range may have zero width, an output range may not. An input
       that never moved during the demonstrations is stored with in_hi = in_lo,
       and iris_internal_norm_in reads it as 0 (PART 5), so that is a range
       this library writes. An output that never moved is given a small width
       of its own by iris_internal_fit_ranges, because the output scaling in
       PART 5 divides by the width, so a file carrying an output range of zero
       width did not come from this library. Either way lo must not pass hi,
       and the width must be a finite number.
     - An identifier that repeats would make "delete #3" ambiguous, and one
       at or above next_id would be handed out again by the next record.

   iris_load CHECKS EVERY RULE BEFORE IT WRITES ANYTHING. A refused file
   returns 0 and leaves the instrument you passed exactly as it was, every
   byte of it, its status included. There is no half-loaded instrument.

   AFTER A LOAD the instrument is the saved one, and it is at rest: fitted and
   trained come from the flags, the momentum velocities are zero, the
   learning rate and momentum are the defaults every instrument starts with,
   the record of which demonstration fights the others (PART 8f) is empty,
   any sliced training run is over, the status is IRIS_STATUS_OK, and
   iris_last_error is measured afresh over the demonstrations. For an
   instrument whose fit still matches its demonstrations that is the figure
   it reported before the save, to the bit. For a stale one -- a take
   recorded or deleted since the last fit -- it is not: the saved instrument
   still reported the error over the demonstrations it was fitted on, and
   the load measures the same weights over the demonstrations the file
   holds now.

   WHY FITTED AND TRAINED ARE TWO BITS. `fitted` means this instrument has
   produced a fit and plays it; `trained` means that fit still describes the
   demonstrations stored with it. Record one more take after training and the
   instrument is fitted but not trained: it keeps playing. iris_save writes
   the two separately, so after a save and a load it still plays, the same
   bits as before, and iris_is_trained still says 0.

   THE SMOOTHING FIELD is the setting, 0 to 1, as iris_get_smoothing reports
   it, and loading applies it exactly as iris_set_smoothing does. That round
   trip is exact for every setting iris_set_smoothing can produce: checked
   over all 1,065,353,217 floats from 0 to 1, the weight decay after a save
   and a load equals the one before, bit for bit.

   iris_save WRITES ONLY FILES iris_load ACCEPTS. It checks its own output
   against the same rules and returns 0 -- clearing what it wrote -- if the
   instrument breaks one. A finite instrument that this library made always
   saves. What can make it refuse: a weight or a demonstration that is not
   finite, which only an IRIS_NO_GUARDS build lets into the instrument;
   demonstrations spread so far apart that a range's width overflows a float;
   and more than two thousand million recorded takes. Refusing at save time
   tells you while the instrument is still in front of you, rather than after
   a power cycle.

   ONE THING THE CHECKSUM CANNOT DO. It certifies the bytes that were
   written, not that they all came from the same instant. If the instrument
   changes while iris_save is copying it -- a second thread, an interrupt,
   the sliced trainer driven from a timer -- the buffer holds a mixture of two
   instruments, and the checksum, computed over the mixture, matches it by
   construction. If every value in the mixture obeys the rules, it loads. One
   instrument belongs to one thread (see THREADING, above iris_get_status); do
   not save an instrument that something else may be touching.

/* ==========================================================================
   PART 10 — THE SECOND ALGORITHM  (k-NN blending and 1-NN snapping)

   k-NN is "k nearest neighbours": answer a gesture by finding the k
   demonstrations nearest to it and blending what they said. 1-NN is the
   case k = 1, snapping to the single nearest one. The network of PARTS 6
   and 8, a multilayer perceptron, is called the MLP below.

   A different character of instrument, not a quality tier. Desktop
   Wekinator ships k-NN as its default for discrete (classifier) outputs.
   These two functions play both modes with ZERO training, ZERO seed, and
   ZERO extra arena bytes: they are a weighted read of the demonstrations
   the instrument already carries. The demonstrations ARE the model, the
   design rule of this whole file taken to its logical end.

   What that means:

     - THIS ALGORITHM DOES NOT REROLL. There is no seed and nothing random;
       the same demonstrations always give the same instrument, bit for bit. It
       is sampler-like where the MLP is morph-like: it plays back and
       blends your demonstrations.

     - RECALL. Standing on a demonstration returns that demonstration: to
       the bit from iris_classify_1nn, and to within rounding from
       iris_knn_predict, where the demonstration you stand on carries a
       weight of about 1e9 against 1/d^2 for each other neighbour (the
       exact-recall check in tests/audit.c measures a worst error of 6e-8 on
       outputs between 0 and 1). Only another demonstration almost on top of
       it pulls the answer measurably away. The MLP does not quite get there:
       trained to its plateau it misses its own demonstrations by a
       root-mean-square 0.0012 on outputs whose demonstrated ranges are 0.45
       to 0.8 wide, about 0.2% of the range (the convergence check in
       tests/audit.c).

     - SEAMS, ON PURPOSE. Between two demonstrations the output can step 31
       times more sharply than its mean step, where the MLP's morph steps
       1.9 times (docs/adr/0010-knn-the-sampler-beside-the-morpher.md records
       the measurement). That is the
       sampler character.

     - STRUCTURAL SAFETY. The answer is a weighted average of demonstrated
       outputs, held inside their range: it is never a not-a-number and
       never leaves the range you demonstrated, whatever finite reading comes
       in, however far from every take (a reading that is not finite is
       refused, with the substitute and IRIS_NAN_TRAPPED). When every
       neighbour carries the same value, the answer is exactly that value.

     - THE ACCURACY FLOOR. The MLP generalises better at EVERY count of
       demonstrations measured (2.4 times at 5, 2.1 times at 200;
       docs/adr/0010-knn-the-sampler-beside-the-morpher.md). Choose
       k-NN for its character, never for accuracy. For discrete outputs use
       iris_classify_1nn, which returns a stored label verbatim: a blend of
       labels is exactly a label only where all k neighbours agree, and a
       value between labels where they do not.

   Distances count each input in fractions of its demonstrated range, so a
   millimetre sensor and a g-force sensor count equally, and an input that
   never moved counts not at all (PART 5). The ranges are the instrument's own:
   the ones it was last fitted to, or, on an instrument that has never been
   fitted, the current demonstrations' ranges, fitted on every call. A fitted
   instrument keeps its ranges when you record or delete; train again to
   measure in the new ones. (iris_internal_fit_ranges alone would do it too,
   but it would also change what iris_predict plays, because the network was
   trained on the old ranges.) Ties resolve to the earliest-recorded
   demonstration, the same rule as Weka's LinearNNSearch, the search under
   desktop Wekinator's classifier, so decisions are comparable. The Java
   program itself has not been run against this code: the tests/audit.c
   check "1-NN: agrees with the Weka-IBk reference" compares it with a
   double-precision reference written to the same rules.

   Every saved instrument can play this way with nothing added to its file:
   the demonstrations and ranges are already in it. The file does not record which
   algorithm you play it with; that is a choice made at run time.

/* THE FAR DISTANCE, for when every ordinary distance has overflowed: the

   WHEN IT IS NEEDED. The ranges are the ones the instrument was last fitted
   to, and a take recorded since can lie any distance outside them: a take at
   1e20 on an input fitted to 0..1 is 1e20 ranges from a reading of 0.5, and
   the square of that overflows to infinity. With every stored take that far
   out no ordinary distance is finite, so a finite reading would have no
   nearest take: iris_knn_predict would play its substitute, outside the
   outputs demonstrated, iris_classify_1nn would answer -1 and
   iris_delete_nearest would delete nothing, with takes stored. The neighbour
   functions scan again with this distance instead. Capped, each input adds at
   most 10^30, so between finite numbers it is always finite, and below 10^38
   for any IRIS_MAX_IN up to 340,000. Skipping a still input keeps an overflowed
   difference times its zero scale from making a not-a-number.

   WHY ONLY THEN. The skip and the two comparisons per input slow the scan
   by more than half: 4,000 k-nearest and 1-nearest queries over 2,000 takes
   of 8 inputs take 0.186 s with them in the ordinary distance and 0.118 s
   without (Apple clang -O2, the development laptop). Used only when no

  /* THE BLEND, written as the nearest neighbour's value plus the weighted mean
     of how far each neighbour's value lies from it:

         out = y0 + sum( s * (y - y0) ),    s = w / sum( w )

     where s is a neighbour's share of the total weight. That is the ordinary
     weighted mean, sum(w * y) / sum(w), rearranged, and the rearrangement is
     what makes it exact when every neighbour agrees: each difference is then
     exactly zero, so the answer is exactly y0. The ordinary form rounds: run
     through the checks in tests/playing.c, it fails to return the label on
     291,862 of 364,140 queries on stores whose labels all agree (a label of 3
     comes back as 2.9999998, which a C cast to int turns into class 2), and
     44,504 of 800,000 random queries land a few steps of float resolution
     outside the demonstrated range.

     The shares are worked out before they multiply anything. A weight
     reaches 1e9 on a demonstration you stand on, so w * (y - y0) overflows
     once two values differ by more than about 3e29; a share is at most 1, so
     s * (y - y0) is never larger than the difference it scales.

     This form stays inside without help: the nearest neighbour carries the
     largest weight, so the mean keeps a margin from either end of the range
     that rounding cannot cross (0 of the 800,000, and 0 of 1,000,000 queries
     on stores built from values at the very ends of their range). The answer
     is still held between the smallest and largest of the neighbours' values,
     for the one case that argument does not cover: two values of opposite
     sign whose difference is larger than the largest float and overflows to
     infinity.

     The nearest neighbour's own term is s * (y0 - y0), which is zero, so the
     sum starts at the second slot. Fewer than kk rows can be in the slots
     when some distances are not finite; the blend uses the ones that are
     there. */
