   iris.h  —  interactive machine learning for handmade instruments
   v0.1.0 · single file · C99 · no dependencies · no malloc · no libc

   You show it a handful of examples of "when I do THIS, it sounds like THAT".
   It learns a mapping and fills in everything in between.

   This is the whole brain of the instrument. The same file compiles for a
   laptop, a web browser, and an ESP32-S3, because it contains no hardware,
   no operating system, and no library calls. It is pure arithmetic on
   memory you hand it.

   THE ZERO-DEPENDENCY CLAIM, STATED EXACTLY. A translation unit exercising
   the whole public API compiles under -std=c99 -ffreestanding -nostdlib at
   -O0/-O2/-Os and links with ZERO undefined symbols — but only with
   -fno-stack-protector, ON A HOST. Verified 2026-08-27, Apple clang 17, arm64.

   AND ON THE CHIP IT IS ACTUALLY FOR, IT IS NOT ZERO. Measured 2026-08-30 with
   the ESP32-S3's own compiler (xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gcc, -Os -ffreestanding
   -fno-stack-protector), which this line previously marked UNVERIFIED:

     the playing path        __divsf3, memset, sqrtf
     + iris_loo_error        + __adddf3 __divdf3 __extendsfdf2 __floatsidf
                               __muldf3 __subdf3 __truncdfsf2
     + iris_suggest_smoothing  the same, plus memcpy
     + iris_train_elm        adds nothing

   __divsf3 is single-precision DIVISION: the S3's floating-point unit has no
   divide instruction, so every float division is a libgcc call. memset and
   sqrtf are the compiler's and libm's. None of this is a call this source
   writes, and all of it is present on every Arduino build anyway -- but the
   sentence "zero undefined symbols" is FALSE on the target, and it is now
   stated with the compiler, the flags and the list rather than as a claim.

   THE DOUBLES ARE REAL AND THEY ARE ONE FUNCTION. The __*df3 routines above
   are 64-bit soft float, which rule 3 below says this library does not use.
   iris_loo_error accumulates its error sum in double on purpose (iris.h, PART
   8c) and iris_suggest_smoothing calls it. That is a deliberate numerical
   choice in a diagnostic that is not on the playing path, and it is the ONLY
   exception -- the playing path has no doubles anywhere. Rule 3 is restated
   below with that exception named, because a rule with a silent exception is
   worse than no rule.

   THE THREE RULES THIS FILE OBEYS
     1. No malloc.  You give it one block of memory; it never asks for more.
        You always know exactly how much RAM the instrument uses.
     2. No libc.    No printf, no math.h. Everything it needs is in here.
     3. No doubles ON THE PLAYING PATH. The ESP32-S3 does 32-bit float in
        hardware and 64-bit float in slow software emulation. The one
        exception is iris_loo_error (and iris_suggest_smoothing, which calls
        it), a diagnostic that accumulates in double deliberately; measured
        above.

   USAGE
     static unsigned char mem[IRIS_ARENA(2, 12, 3, 64)];
     iris *k = iris_init(mem, sizeof mem, 2, 12, 3, 64, 12345);

     iris_record(k, gesture, sound);     // do this a few times
     iris_train_converge(k, 0, 0, 0);    // trains until the error plateaus
     iris_predict(k, gesture, sound);    // now play

   THE WORDS THIS FILE USES, defined once, here, before it uses them.
   CONTRIBUTING.md asks for no bare acronyms and the audience includes musicians and first-year
   students, so:

     EPOCH        one pass over every demonstration you have recorded. Training
                  is thousands of these. "9,000 epochs" means the network saw
                  each of your takes 9,000 times.
     ELM          extreme learning machine. A second, instant way to train:
                  freeze the random middle layer and solve the output layer
                  exactly, in one step, instead of nudging it thousands of
                  times. PART 8d.
     RIDGE        a small number added down the diagonal of a matrix before
                  solving it, which stops the solve failing when two
                  demonstrations are nearly identical. PART 8d.
     SGD          stochastic gradient descent — nudging the weights after each
                  single demonstration rather than after all of them.
     ULP          unit in the last place: the smallest change you can make to a
                  floating-point number. "1 ulp" means one step, the smallest
                  difference two floats can have.
     CHOLESKY     a standard, fast way to solve a symmetric system of linear
                  equations. Used once, in the ELM path.
     NORMAL MATRIX  the square matrix that least-squares fitting produces and
                  Cholesky then solves.
     ODR          the one-definition rule: C and C++ require that a thing is
                  defined identically everywhere it appears.

   ON TRAINING TIME. iris_train_converge runs until the training error stops
   improving, with a hard ceiling — typically 9,000-18,000 epochs, which is
   ~25-45 ms on a laptop and ~1-4 s on an ESP32-S3 at 20-50 examples. That is
   twenty times the old fixed 600-epoch recommendation and it buys a 5.9x
   better recall of your own demonstrations; the table is in PART 8. If you
   need the UI to stay alive across those seconds, take the same run in
   slices: iris_train_begin / iris_train_slice / iris_train_progress, which is
   bit-identical to the blocking call.

   iris_train_epochs(k, n) is still here, unchanged and permanent: it is the
   fixed-epoch backprop that Wekinator's Weka MultilayerPerceptron does, and
   the audit pins its output to the bit.

   ON OLD FILES. iris_save / iris_load carry the INPUT SCALING in the version
   word: v1 and v2 files were written when inputs were scaled to [0,1], v3
   onwards to [-1,+1]. An instrument loaded from an old file keeps the old
   scaling for as long as it exists — including across re-training, and it
   saves itself back as v2 — because its weights mean nothing else. That is
   automatic and you do not have to think about it.

   What you may want to offer the musician is the way out:

     if (!iris_input_scaling(k))          // 0 = this came from an old file
       if (asked_nicely()) iris_migrate_scaling(k);

   iris_migrate_scaling re-fits the same demonstrations under the new scaling.
   It is a NEW FIT, not a conversion: the instrument moves by about the fit
   error (0.045 measured), so it is the musician's decision, never a default.
   See PART 9.

   THE WHOLE INTERFACE, ON ONE SCREEN

   Eleven functions. Everything else in this file is detail you can reach for
   later. `k` is the instrument. `in` and `out` are plain float arrays you own.

     iris *iris_init(mem, sizeof mem, n_in, n_hid, n_out, cap, seed)
         Hands back an instrument built inside YOUR memory. The four numbers
         are: how many sensor values come in, how wide the hidden layer is
         (12 is a good answer; 8 is the minimum), how many things you control,
         and how many demonstrations you can store. They must match the four
         you gave IRIS_ARENA. Returns 0 if they do not.

     int   iris_record(k, in, out)     in: n_in floats     out: n_out floats
         Stores one demonstration: this gesture goes with that sound.
         Returns its identifier (1 or higher). Returns 0 if it refused.

     int   iris_train(k)
         Fits the demonstrations you have now, from a defined start.
         Returns 1, or 0 if it refused. How WELL it fits is a separate
         question: iris_last_error(k).

     int   iris_is_trained(k)          did the last fit actually happen?
         1 if this instrument is fitted, 0 if it is not. Correct after EVERY
         trainer in this file -- which matters, because `if (iris_train_elm(...))`
         is FALSE on its best outcome and `if (iris_train_converge(...))` is
         TRUE on refusal. See "HOW EVERY FUNCTION REPORTS FAILURE" for the
         measured table. If you only ever ask one question about training,
         ask this one.

     void  iris_predict(k, in, out)    READS n_in, WRITES n_out floats
         The playing call. It writes exactly n_out floats into `out`; if your
         array is shorter than that, it writes past the end and nothing warns
         you. This is the one thing to get right.

     int   iris_count(k)               how many demonstrations are stored
     int   iris_delete_id(k, id)       remove one, by the identifier above
     int   iris_worst_example_id(k, m) which demonstration fights the others
     iris_status iris_get_status(k)    is the INSTRUMENT unwell? 0 is healthy
     size_t iris_save(k, buf, cap)     bytes written, or 0
     int   iris_load(k, buf, n)        1, or 0

   FAILURE, in two rules and no exceptions:
     A call that either works or does not returns 0 for "did nothing".
     A call that returns a MEASUREMENT returns it, or -1 if it refused.
   iris_get_status answers a different question -- whether the INSTRUMENT is in
   trouble. Zero means opposite things in the two places, so do not carry one
   habit across: a RETURN VALUE of 0 is bad news (the call did nothing), and a
   STATUS of 0 is good news (IRIS_STATUS_OK, nothing is wrong). Two of these
   sentences used to say "0 is the good news in both" and "0 is the bad news in
   both", and neither was right about both.

   THREADING: never touch the same instrument from two places at once. That is
   the entire contract; see the note above iris_get_status for why.

   Units: none. Feed it raw sensor readings. It fits its own range to whatever
   you actually give it, so scaling, centring and normalising are not merely
   unnecessary, they are the wrong thing to do.

   Nine arrays inside this file are sized by these numbers rather than by the
   shape you actually asked for -- iris_internal_train_run alone reserves
   float x[IRIS_MAX_IN] and float t[IRIS_MAX_OUT], 192 bytes, whether your
   instrument has 32 inputs or 2. Measured with avr-gcc -Os -fstack-usage on
   an atmega328p: iris_internal_train_run 286 bytes, iris_predict 164. An Uno has
   2 KB of memory in total and the getting-started sketch leaves a few hundred
   bytes of stack, so the defaults below do not fit it with room to spare.

   They are #ifndef so you can shrink them. Define them BEFORE including this

   to 126, iris_predict from 164 to 52, and the deepest frame from 340 to 132.
   The only rule is that they must be at least as large as the n_in, n_out and
   n_hid you pass to iris_init -- which iris_init checks, and refuses if not.

/* EVERY PRODUCT IS COMPUTED IN unsigned long, WHICH C GUARANTEES IS AT LEAST
   32 BITS, AND NOT IN size_t.

   On a 16-bit size_t target -- every Arduino AVR board -- these products wrap.
   That on its own would be survivable if anything noticed, but iris_size wrapped
   IDENTICALLY, so iris_init compared a wrapped need against an equally wrapped
   array size and could not refuse: IRIS_ARENA(24,63,16,254) came out as 88
   bytes for an instrument that needs 65,624, and the first loop of iris_reseed
   then wrote 6,048 bytes into those 88. Verified with avr-gcc for atmega328p.

   Computing wide makes the true number appear. In C, that number is then too
   large for an array and the COMPILER refuses the declaration -- a build error
   naming the array, which is the outcome we want.

   IN C++ IT IS A RUNTIME REFUSAL INSTEAD, AND ARDUINO COMPILES .ino AS C++.
   An array declarator's size in C++ converts to std::size_t, 16 bits on AVR, so
   the bound wraps silently where C errors. Measured with avr-g++ on an
   atmega328p, all four as compile-time assertions:

     IRIS_ARENA(24,63,16,254)          65624   (wide, correct)
     sizeof mem                           88   (the ARRAY narrowed)
     iris_size(24,63,16,254)               0   (cannot be sized here)

   The narrowing threshold and the sizing threshold are the SAME number, so
   every shape the array silently shrinks is a shape iris_size refuses: the
   `need == 0` test in iris_init returns 0 and the sketch gets a null pointer,
   which every example in this repository checks. So the failure is loud, just
   later than it should be -- a message at run time rather than a build error.
   Do not read this as memory corruption; an audit reported it as such and the
   assertions above are why that is wrong. */

/* ==========================================================================
   PART 1 — MATH WE PROVIDE OURSELVES

   We can't call math.h, so these are here. They are also *faster* than the
   library versions, which matters more than you'd think: the network calls
   tanh once per hidden unit per direction per example per epoch. With 12
   hidden units, 20 examples and 16,000 epochs that is 7.7 million calls.

   ON THE COST. The primary reason this routine exists is the no-libc rule,
   not speed. On the ESP32-S3, newlib's tanhf is ESTIMATED at 150-400 cycles
   (briefs/03-esp32s3-feasibility.md:112, marked [E] — not measured on the
   part). On a laptop the measured margin over libm tanhf is about 2x, not
   30x. Do not repeat an unqualified "300 cycles" or "worth more than every
   other optimization combined": neither figure survives scrutiny.
   ========================================================================== */

/* THE NONLINEARITY. Chosen, measured, and now permanent.

   p(x) = x(27+x^2)/(27+9x^2), clamped to tanh's codomain.

   THIS IS NOT A CHEAP STAND-IN FOR tanh THAT WE REGRET. It was measured
   against a far more accurate approximant and against true tanh itself, over
   6 target shapes and 2,304 paired runs, and it WON on held-out error. The
   reason is that accuracy is not the objective: this function overshoots tanh
   in the mid-range, which makes it a steeper sigmoid with a hard floor on
   gradient flow past |s| = 3, and that is capacity control. It is doing useful
   work, not merely approximating. Design, arms and numbers: docs/FREEZE.md.

   Two exact facts make the clamp correct rather than arbitrary:
   p(x) - 1 = (x-3)^3/(27+9x^2), so p(3) = 1 EXACTLY, and
   p'(x) = ((x^2-9)/(3(3+x^2)))^2 >= 0, so p is monotone and p'(3) = 0 exactly.
   Clamping the RETURN VALUE is therefore identical to clamping the argument at
   |x| = 3, and strictly better: an argument clamp leaves a 1-ulp escape (10,220
   floats in [2.5,3.0] still evaluate above 1.0f). It is also branch-free, so
   its cost does not depend on the data.

   CONSEQUENCE, STATED PLAINLY AND PERMANENTLY. (1 - a*a) is the derivative of
   TRUE tanh, not of this function, so the backward pass is a surrogate
   gradient -- under-scaled by 2.4-3.3% in aggregate, never wrong-signed. It is
   not a defect being tolerated; it is a described property of a chosen
   nonlinearity, and it can be revisited any time it earns its measured 1.4%
   without changing what a saved instrument means.

   The +/-1e9 test only keeps x*(27+x^2) finite; it is not the saturation point.
   It was documented here as never firing, on the reasoning that pre-activations
   are bounded by IRIS_W_LIMIT. That is wrong, and the guard is load-bearing:
   iris_predict does NOT clamp its input, iris_norm_in scales it, so a reading
   of 1e20 arrives at iris_tanh as 2e20. There x*(27+x^2) overflows to inf and
   27+9x^2 overflows to inf, and inf/inf is a not-a-number -- every hidden unit
   would be NaN. Measured: with the test, iris_predict(1e20) returns 1.000000;
   the bare ratio at that argument is nan.

   alone, deliberately, so that one out-of-range query cannot leave a polled
   user interface showing a fault for ever. So: check the return value of the
   call you made, and check this for whether the instrument itself is in
   trouble. Two questions, two answers. (CHANGELOG.md, 0.1.0.) */

/* THREADING, IN ONE SENTENCE.

       Never touch the same instrument from two places at once.

   That is the whole contract, and it is short because there is no mutable
   state anywhere outside the instrument you passed in -- no globals, no static
   buffers, no shared scratch -- so two instruments cannot interact on any
   number of cores.

   SAFE: many instruments on one core, one after another; one instrument per
   thread across as many cores as you have; one instrument used only inside an
   interrupt -- but read the PLATFORM CAVEAT below before you do that last one.

   NOT SAFE: the SAME instrument from an interrupt and the main loop.
   iris_predict writes its working values inside the instrument, so an
   interrupt landing mid-call leaves both answers wrong. Give the interrupt its
   own instrument. The full table and the cross-talk verification are in
   README.md under "Threading".

   PLATFORM CAVEAT, and it decides the interrupt case on the board this library
   is usually run on. Everything above is a statement about THIS CODE: iris
   keeps no global or static state, so separate instruments cannot interfere.
   It is not a promise about your chip. On an ESP32 under FreeRTOS the
   floating-point registers are not saved when an interrupt is taken, so any
   float arithmetic inside an interrupt handler -- iris or anyone else's --
   can corrupt the interrupted task's registers, silently. iris is float
   throughout. So on that platform, do not call any iris_ function from an
   interrupt handler: read the sensor there, set a flag, and call iris from the
   main loop. The C-level statement above stands wherever interrupt entry does
   save the floating-point registers.

   TIMING, for the audio case. One prediction is 14.9 microseconds on an
   ESP32-S3 against a 20.8 microsecond audio sample at 48 kHz -- 1.4x of
   margin, enough to run per-sample and not enough to also do anything
   expensive in the same callback. That figure is measured on the part, not
   scaled: device_torture.ino test 9, two boards. This line said 7.4-7.8 until
   2026-08-30, which was a host measurement multiplied by an estimated 270 and
   printed as if taken on the part; the provenance is in README.md and
   docs/SYSTEM-technical.md. TRAINING does not fit and is not close: 595 ms at
   4 demonstrations, 2.7-3.0 s at 8 to 20. Train in slices from the main loop
   -- see iris_train_slice -- and never from an interrupt. */

/* HOW EVERY FUNCTION IN THIS FILE REPORTS FAILURE — two rules, and only two.

   Use that, and stop reading here if that is all you need. It is correct after
   EVERY trainer in this file, and no other test is.

   Here is why it has to exist. The two rules below are each individually sound,
   but they meet badly in C, and `if (trainer(...))` is wrong in BOTH directions
   depending on which trainer you called. Measured, all six on the same data:

     on a fit that WORKED        return   if(return)   iris_is_trained
       iris_train                 1.0000    true            1

       iris_retrain_new           0.0003    true            1

     on a fit that REFUSED
       iris_train                 0.0000    false           0
       iris_train_epochs         -1.0000    TRUE            0   <-- -1 is truthy
       iris_train_converge       -1.0000    TRUE            0
       iris_train_elm            -1.0000    TRUE            0
       iris_correct              -1.0000    TRUE            0
       iris_retrain_new          -1.0000    TRUE            0

   iris_train_elm returns the number of ridge escalations, so 0 is its BEST
   outcome and reads as false. The rest return a measurement, and -1 is a
   perfectly ordinary non-zero float, so a refusal reads as true. Neither is a
   bug in the rules; it is what happens when "did it work" is asked of a number
   that was never meant to answer it.

   iris_is_trained reads one flag that every trainer sets on success and no
   trainer sets on refusal. It is the same answer whichever door you came in.

   RULE 1, for a call that either works or does not:
       0 means the call did nothing. Non-zero means it worked.
   That covers iris_record, iris_train, the delete functions, iris_load,
   iris_save, iris_size, iris_train_begin and iris_migrate_scaling. Nothing to
   look up: zero is bad. iris_record returns the new demonstration's
   identifier on success, which is naturally non-zero because identifiers start
   at 1 -- so it obeys the rule AND hands you the number you need later to
   delete or re-map that specific take.

   RULE 2, for a call that returns a MEASUREMENT you asked for:
       the measurement on success, -1 on refusal.
   That covers the detailed trainers (which return the training error),
   iris_loo_error, iris_suggest_smoothing, iris_worst_example, iris_index_of
   and iris_classify_1nn. These cannot use rule 1 because zero is often a
   perfectly good answer -- iris_train_elm returns the number of ridge
   escalations, and none needed is the best possible outcome.

   And a separate question, with a separate answer: is the INSTRUMENT in
   trouble? That is iris_get_status, below. A call can succeed on an
   instrument that is unwell, and a call can fail on a perfectly good one.
   Two questions, two answers -- and zero means the OPPOSITE thing in each. A
   return value of 0 says the call did nothing; a status of 0 (IRIS_STATUS_OK)
   says nothing is wrong. See the note in PART 1, which says the same thing.

/* INTERNAL. Was public until 2026-08-27; removed from the public surface
   because it is measurably a footgun and buys nothing.

   MOMENTUM 0.99 — one nudge from the 0.85 default — DIVERGED 21 of 40 runs and
   BRICKED 20 of them at the default learning rate (structured target, 40 seeds,
   sigma=0.05). "Bricked" means the musician lowers it back, retrains, and gets
   IRIS_DIVERGED_STUCK forever; only a reroll recovers, and a reroll is a
   different instrument.

   LR 2.0, the old permitted maximum, destroyed 5 of 16: recall 73x worse than
   default, grid error 6.6x worse. Weka's own documented range for the same
   parameter is 0-1; we permitted double it.

   AND THE SAFE RANGES DO NOTHING. Momentum 0.00 to 0.95 is flat on instrument
   quality (grid 0.0257 to 0.0290) — it is a SPEED knob, and iris_train_converge
   already hides speed. lr's safe range is covered entirely by smoothing: tuning
   lr, tuning l2 and tuning the epoch ceiling land within 2-4% of each other,
   because they are three spellings of one axis.

   WORSE, THE ONLY READOUT A UI CAN SHOW POINTS BACKWARDS. At sigma=0.10:
   lr=0.001 gives training MSE 1.17e-2 and the BEST instrument (grid 0.0693);
   lr=0.050 gives training MSE 1.25e-3 and nearly the WORST (grid 0.1472). A
   student tuning by watching the error readout reliably picks the worst
   setting on offer.

/* WEIGHT DECAY (L2). Off by default, and the default is the finding.

   THE PROBLEM IT ADDRESSES, stated as a reviewer states it: this network has
   ~75 parameters and you are fitting 3xN targets. At N=20 that is more
   parameters than training scalars, trained to a plateau with no capacity
   control. With noisy demonstrations — which is what a human produces — it
   fits the noise.

   MEASURED (32 paired seeds, identical data and identical initial weights,
   held-out RMSE on a fixed clean grid, docs/MATH-FIXES.md defect 2):

     structured target, N=20, no noise      alpha=1e-3  -19.7%   (better)
     structured target, N=20, sigma=0.05    alpha=1e-3  -40.3%   (better)
     smooth target,     N=20, sigma=0.05    best alpha  -65.2%   (better)
     smooth target,     N=20, NO noise      alpha=1e-2  +34.9%   (WORSE)

   Sign test to p = 4.7e-10, disjoint IQRs in the large cells, surviving
   Benjamini-Hochberg over 224 arm-by-cell tests. Also: plain plateau training
   produced 4 IRIS_TRAINING_DIVERGED events at sigma=0.10; alpha >= 1e-3
   produced zero, anywhere.

   WHY THE DEFAULT IS STILL ZERO. No single alpha is safe across every target
   and noise level — the same 1e-3 that wins by 40% on a structured noisy target
   costs 9.3% on a clean smooth one, and 1e-2 costs 34.9%. Shipping a default
   that is wrong half the time to fix a problem that appears the other half is
   not an improvement, it is a coin flip with our name on it. So: the mechanism
   ships, the default does not, and the numbers above tell you when to reach
   for it. If your demonstrations are noisy — recorded from a human, from a real
   sensor — start at 1e-3.

   CAVEAT THAT MUST TRAVEL WITH THE NUMBER. This is NOT directly comparable to
   scikit-learn's alpha, even though the scale looks familiar. iris_fit_ranges
   derives normalisation from the training data's own observed range, and noise
   inflates that range by 0.58x to 1.39x across the grid, so the effective
   penalty moves with N and with noise. Comparable only under matched
   preprocessing, which no sklearn user has.

   Applied as decoupled decay on the weights only, never the biases: penalising
   a bias just shifts the function for no capacity benefit. */

   This is the ONLY knob in the library that changes how good the instrument is
   rather than how big or how fast it is, and it is the only one worth a
   musician's attention. It maps onto weight decay, but nobody should have to
   know that to use it.

   WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL, measured (12 tasks x 3 noise levels, held-out grid
   error against clean truth):

       noise      smoothing 0     tuned smoothing

       heavy         0.2161           0.0904

   At realistic take-to-take inconsistency it is worth about 2.4x. Nothing else
   in the library comes close, and — this is the part that justifies collapsing
   five other knobs into this one — tuning the learning rate, or the epoch
   ceiling, or the hidden width, lands within 2-4% of this. They were five
   spellings of one axis. This is the spelling that is safe: measured monotone
   across its whole range and ZERO divergences at any value, where momentum at

   PART 5 — NORMALISATION

   Find the range of every input and output across the examples, then map
   everything into a common scale before training.

   Outputs go to 0.1–0.9 rather than 0–1 on purpose. The output layer uses a
   sigmoid. A true logistic only APPROACHES 0 and 1; this one is built on a
   clamped rational function and reaches them exactly — iris_sigmoid(6.0f) is
   1.0f on the nose. Asking it to hit exactly 1.0 means pushing a weight toward
   infinity forever; leaving headroom at both ends means the network can
   actually arrive.

   WHERE THIS CONSTANT ACTUALLY COMES FROM, stated honestly because this
   paragraph used to promise "the measurement below" and there is no
   measurement below -- the block ends here. 0.1/0.9 is a folklore rule of
   thumb, not a derived value. LeCun's Efficient BackProp section 4.5 derives
   the principled band from the maximum of the sigmoid's second derivative,
   which is 0.2113/0.7887, and docs/MATH-AUDIT.md:101 records that the shipped
   band therefore delivers 1.85x LESS gradient at the targets. It stays because
   moving it changes every frozen hash and every saved file's output mapping
   (docs/MATH-AUDIT.md:274 costs that out), not because it was measured to be
   better. It was not.

   PART 7 — HOW LOST AM I?

   Distance from the current gesture to the nearest thing you demonstrated.
   0 means "exactly on an example".

   WHAT 1 MEANS, precisely, because the obvious reading is wrong. The scale is
   sqrt(n_in)/2 -- a constant that depends only on how many sensors you have,
   NOT on how far apart your demonstrations are. So 1 means "half the diagonal
   of the normalised input box away from the nearest example", and that is a
   fixed distance, not a relative one.

   The consequence is worth knowing before you map this to anything. With four
   corner demonstrations -- which is examples/00_minimal.c -- 60.3% of the
   gesture square reads exactly 1.0, including the middle of the demonstrated
   space; it reports the same value for "between your four takes" and "ten
   times outside them". With twenty-five demonstrations it never exceeds 0.48.
   The usable range of the control therefore depends on how many takes you
   recorded, and two instruments are not comparable.

   Making the scale relative to the examples' own spacing would fix that and is
   what this comment used to promise. It is deliberately NOT done here: the
   audit uses novelty to sort probes into near and far bands, so changing the
   scale moves measured thresholds elsewhere, and that deserves its own
   measurement rather than a quiet edit.

   This costs one pass over the examples — nothing. But it lets the instrument
   know when it is improvising rather than recalling, which you can map to
   anything you like: noise, detuning, a light. As far as I can find, nobody
   has done this, and it is four lines.

   PART 8 — TRAINING  (backpropagation)

   The only genuinely new idea in this file, and it is one idea:

     Run an example forward. Compare what came out to what you demonstrated.
     Nudge every weight a little in whichever direction would have reduced
     that gap. Repeat.

   "Backpropagation" is just bookkeeping for the middle layer: the hidden
   units don't have a target of their own, so you work out how much each one
   contributed to the final error and blame it proportionally.

   Two details that matter in practice:

   MOMENTUM. Instead of stepping purely downhill each time, keep a running
   velocity. Steps in a consistent direction accumulate; steps that jitter
   back and forth cancel. It makes training roughly three times faster and
   costs one extra array.

   SHUFFLING. Present the examples in a different order every epoch. Fixed
   order lets the network learn the order instead of the mapping — the last
   example seen always gets the final say.
   ========================================================================== */

   error) means the numbers are gone — report and recover to a finite state.

   TRAINING TO CONVERGENCE, AND SAYING SO OUT LOUD

   The masthead used to recommend 600 epochs. Measured, that budget stops the
   optimiser less than a fifth of the way down: going to 200,000 improves
   recall 5.9x and held-out error 1.8x for nothing but time, and time is the
   cheap thing here. The full epoch table is docs/adr/0017-train-to-the-plateau-not-to-a-constant.md.

   So the budget is no longer a number the caller guesses. iris_train_converge
   runs until the training error PLATEAUS: every IRIS_CONV_WINDOW epochs it
   compares the error against the error one window ago and stops when the
   window bought less than IRIS_CONV_TOL of it. Window and tolerance are
   measured, not guessed -- a short window (200-500 epochs) mistakes the
   ordinary epoch-to-epoch noise of a shuffled SGD trace for a plateau and
   stops at a quarter of the achievable fit.

   THE ONE PLACE THIS IS NOT FREE. At 50 examples a fixed 200,000-epoch budget
   is measurably WORSE on held-out error than 60,000 -- the point where more
   convergence starts costing generalisation. A plateau criterion stops before
   that on its own; a bigger constant would not have. That is the argument for
   a criterion over a constant.

   AND THE CAVEAT THAT GOVERNS THE WHOLE TABLE. The truth function those
   numbers come from is smooth and noiseless. "More convergence never hurts"
   is exactly the conclusion most at risk from real sensor noise and human
   inconsistency, and none of it is verified on hardware or on recorded human
   gesture. Treat the ceiling as a ceiling.

   HONEST PROGRESS. A converged run at 50 examples is seconds on the S3, long
   enough that the glass must show something true. Two ways in, both free:

     - iris_train_converge(k, ceiling, cb, user) calls cb every window with
       (done, ceiling, err); returning 0 from cb aborts, leaving a usable
       partially-trained instrument.
     - iris_train_begin / iris_train_slice / iris_train_progress run the SAME
       training in slices, so a single-threaded UI can draw a frame, read
       touch and keep the audio half alive between them. A sliced run is
       bit-identical to the equivalent unsliced one: the shuffle buffer is
       initialised once at iris_train_begin and carried across slices, so the
       rng draws are the same draws in the same order.

   iris_train_epochs IS UNCHANGED AND STAYS UNCHANGED. It is the Wekinator
   fidelity path -- fixed-epoch backprop is what Weka's MultilayerPerceptron
   does -- and audit check 12 pins its output to the bit.

     fires again, and training stops after a single epoch. Forever.

     MEASURED 2026-08-27: 14 good demonstrations plus one contradictory take
     diverges; ONE weight of 60 ends up pinned. After deleting the bad example,
     iris_train_converge ran exactly 1 epoch and returned OK-looking on every
     subsequent call, leaving the instrument frozen at its damaged output.
     Zeroing the momentum does not help — it is the pinned weight, not the
     velocity. The musician deletes the bad take, retrains, and nothing happens,
     with no message.

     The examples are fine; the WEIGHTS are destroyed. Refitting from a fresh
     random start recovers the instrument (verified: 0.621 against the 0.618 it
     produced before the damage). So this refuses, loudly and distinguishably,

         ⚠️ THIS IS A SURROGATE GRADIENT, NOT THE GRADIENT. Read this before
         citing anything about the trainer.

         d_out = (predicted - target) * y*(1-y). y*(1-y) is the exact
         derivative of the TRUE logistic. Our forward pass does not use the
         true logistic: iris_sigmoid is built from iris_tanh, the clamped
         rational approximant of PART 1. So the backward pass is not the
         derivative of the forward pass. It is a surrogate -- close enough in
         shape to point downhill, and kept because the measured fits are good
         and changing it would move every golden hash in the audit.

         HOW WRONG. Exact only at zero, and under-scaling by up to 2x across
         the ordinary operating range. The full ratio table is
         docs/MATH-AUDIT.md:153, which is computed on the UNCLAMPED rational
         and does change sign there. THE SHIPPED FUNCTION DOES NOT: the clamp
         bounds a to [-1,1], so 1-a*a is never negative. Measured over
         66,368,438 finite float bit patterns: 0 negatives, with a positive
         control on the unclamped form finding 3,970,919 of 16,527,549. This
         line used to claim the shipped code changes sign, contradicting the
         "never wrong-signed" statement in PART 1; PART 1 was the correct one.

         WHY IT STAYS. The textbook objection is that y*(1-y) collapses the
         gradient exactly when a unit is confidently wrong. Instrumented for
         that event, it fired ZERO times in 48.96 million output-unit updates
         -- it cannot fire at the defaults, because targets live in [0.1,0.9]
         so y*(1-y) >= 0.09 whenever the network is near its target. THE
         HONEST CAVEAT: that is measured absent at the defaults and measured
         PRESENT above a learning rate of 0.5, which the internal setter used
         to permit up to 2.0. Every proposed repair measured worse
         (docs/MATH-FIXES.md defect 3).

         WHAT IS BEING TRADED AWAY, stated plainly rather than buried: one arm
         does beat this -- a cross-entropy gradient with targets left in
         [0.1,0.9], which wins 32/32 seeds at N=20 by ~5%, and ~12% at a tuned
         learning rate. It LOSES at N=10 (1.094x), which is the regime a
         musician actually demonstrates in, and it widens the reroll spread in
         the undemonstrated gaps by 1.6x. Reroll being a real control rather
         than a shrug is a stated promise of this library, and y*(1-y) is the
         brake that keeps it. That is a judgement about the use case sitting on
         top of a measurement, not a measurement by itself, and it is recorded
         here as such.

   It is NOT numerically identical to Weka and cannot be. We compute in
   binary32; Weka computes in binary64 at every step. Exact agreement is
   impossible in principle, not merely unachieved. It also is not identical in
   behaviour: our hidden units use the approximant against their logistic, our output
   units are sigmoid-then-clamp against their unthresholded linear, our
   defaults are lr 0.10 / momentum 0.85 against their 0.3 / 0.2, and we
   reshuffle every epoch where they shuffle once. Same rule, different

     It is expensive for clean demonstrations, and the size of that is worth
     knowing. On a straight one-sensor ramp with twelve evenly spaced takes:

       epochs      training error   worst miss on a demonstrated pose

     falls two orders of magnitude. The plateau outlasts this library's entire
     maximum budget by nearly three times, so nothing here can see past it, and

/* LEAVE-ONE-OUT CROSS-VALIDATION — a real held-out error, at a size where you
   can afford it.

   THE OBJECTION THIS ANSWERS. Everything else in this library measures itself
   against the examples it was fitted on. Training stops when TRAINING error
   plateaus, which is not the same event as "it got as good as it is going to
   get at things it has not seen", and an ML reviewer is right to say so. The
   usual remedy — hold back 20% as a validation set — is unavailable here: at 20
   demonstrations that discards 4 of them, and you cannot spare 4.

   Leave-one-out is the remedy that fits this regime. Hide ONE demonstration,
   refit on the rest, and see how far off the hidden one you land. Do that once
   per demonstration and average. Nothing is discarded; every example is used
   for training in every fold but its own.

   WHAT IT COSTS. n_ex full retrains. At 20 examples on a laptop that is roughly
   half a second; on the ESP32-S3, using the one measured on-device training
   figure (321 ms at 20 examples for 600 epochs), roughly 6 s. That is a
   deliberate, occasional act — "how good is this actually?" — not something to
   put in a play loop.

   HOW TO USE IT. The honest use is comparison, not an absolute grade: run it at
   several l2 values and take the lowest. That is a principled way to pick a
   penalty without the circularity of tuning on the numbers you then report,
   which is the mistake this project has made twice and caught twice.

   HOW WELL IT ACTUALLY WORKS, measured 2026-08-27 rather than assumed. On a
   20-demonstration noisy task, sweeping l2 over {0, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1} and
   comparing what LOO chose against the true error on a clean held-out grid:

       l2        LOO said     truth said
       0         0.002296     0.000577
       1e-4      0.002293     0.000576
       1e-3      0.002273     0.000565
       1e-2      0.002135     0.000500   <- LOO's pick
       1e-1      0.002396     0.000378   <- actually best

   LOO ranked the coarse direction correctly — it put the unregularised arms
   last and identified that a penalty helps — and then chose ONE STEP
   CONSERVATIVE of the true optimum. That is the known behaviour of
   leave-one-out at small n: nearly unbiased but high variance, and each fold
   trains on n-1 examples rather than n, which makes it pessimistic about how
   much regularisation you need. Treat it as a coarse ranking instrument, not a
   precision one: it will tell you whether to regularise and roughly how much,
   and it will not find the exact optimum. Its absolute value is also NOT
   comparable to a grid error — the two columns above differ by ~4x — so use it
   only to compare settings against each other.

   Every fold trains from the SAME seed so the folds differ only by which
   example was hidden. Returns mean squared error per output, or -1 if there are
   fewer than 3 demonstrations to fold over.

   THE INSTRUMENT IS LEFT REFITTED ON ALL EXAMPLES, from that same seed, so it
   is valid to play afterwards — but it is NOT the instrument you had before you
   called this, because it has been retrained. Save first if that matters. */

/* SUGGEST A SMOOTHING VALUE — an explicit, occasional act, not an automatic one.

   Runs leave-one-out across five smoothing settings and returns the one that
   scored best. IT DOES NOT APPLY IT. You get the number, you decide.

   WHY IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC — this was tested as an automatic default and it
   failed the bar set for it:

     - IT IS NOT STABLE. On ONE fixed dataset, re-rolled 16 times, it returned
       2.36 distinct values on average. An instrument whose smoothing changes
       when you reroll is an instrument that stops being predictable, which is
       worse than one that is merely unsmoothed.
     - IT IS SOMETIMES WORSE THAN DOING NOTHING. On 16.7% of datasets its pick
       scored worse than smoothing 0.
     - IT IS SLOW. Five leave-one-out sweeps: ~120 ms on a laptop, but roughly
       37 s on the ESP32-S3 at 20 demonstrations and 202 s at 50, scaled from
       the one measured on-device figure. That is not something to hide inside
       a training call.

   WHAT IT IS GOOD FOR: an honest starting point when you genuinely do not know,
   on a machine where 120 ms is nothing. It captured about 80% of what a perfect
   oracle would have gained at realistic noise levels. Treat the number as a
   suggestion to audition, not an answer — and if you like where you land, pin

   PART 8f — WHICH DEMONSTRATION IS FIGHTING THE OTHERS

   The trial-and-error trap in interactive ML is that when the instrument
   feels wrong you have no idea WHICH of your twenty demonstrations is wrong,
   so you re-record at random. This points at one.

   IT IS THE INTEGRAL, NOT THE ENDPOINT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE IDEA.
   The obvious detector is the final training residual: after training, ask
   each example how badly the model still misses it. It gets WORSE as the
   mistake gets bigger, because given enough epochs the optimiser bends the
   surface far enough to fit the bad point too, after which it looks like
   every other point. So this sums each example's squared error over EVERY
   epoch instead, which measures how long it fought rather than where it
   ended up. An example that agrees with its neighbours is fitted early and
   stays fitted; one that contradicts them stays wrong for thousands of
   epochs. That ranking is stable across training budgets where the endpoint
   is not.

   WHAT YOU GET BACK IS A MARGIN, NOT A LEVEL, and that is deliberate. The
   worst-of-n stress score rises with n on clean data with nothing wrong at
   all, so a user interface wired to a fixed level would be silent on small
   rigs and cry wolf on large ones. Worst divided by second-worst does not
   drift. IRIS_STRESS_FLAG is 2.5.

   BELOW IRIS_STRESS_MIN_EX (12) IT RETURNS -1 AND SAYS NOTHING. An example
   can only be caught disagreeing with a crowd if there is a crowd; at ten
   demonstrations the clean margin alone reaches 5.04, which would be a false
   accusation. That is the situation, not a tuning failure.

   TWO LIMITS THAT TRAVEL WITH IT. A 5% offset on one of eight outputs is
   smaller than the spread between two takes of the same human gesture, and
   nothing here finds it reliably -- this function does not pretend to. And
   every number behind it comes from a clean offset on a smooth, noiseless
   truth: real demonstrations are inconsistent in ways that are not one
   displaced output, and none of this has been checked against a recorded
   human gesture.

   COST. sizeof(float) * cap in the arena -- 512 B at cap 128, 1 KB at cap 256
   -- and one float add per example per epoch, under 0.1% of the backprop work
   already being done for that example. Not free; that is the price.

   PART 8b — THE CORRECTION  (warm start)

   The musician just recorded one more example (or deleted one) and wants the
   instrument fixed NOW, without losing the instrument they practised. The
   old way — retrain from the seed — rewrites the mapping EVERYWHERE at an
   honest budget (measured drift 0.030 far from the correction at 30 epochs);
   that is the documented way musicians lose accumulated technique to
   retraining (Fiebrink & Sonami, NIME 2020). The fix is embarrassingly
   simple: don't reseed. Keep the trained weights, zero the momentum, run a
   short burst. Measured at 20 examples: equal fit to a cold 600-epoch
   retrain, 9x less collateral change, 27x faster.

   THE POLICY AS DESIGNED: record or delete an example, then call iris_correct —
   same instrument, fixed. An explicit reroll gesture calls iris_retrain_new —
   deliberately a NEW instrument. Nothing else reseeds.

   ⚠️ NOTHING SHIPPED CALLS THIS. iris_correct has no caller in this
   repository outside the tests, and the instrument application it was written
   for stopped using it in August 2026 in favour of the ELM solve. ADR 0005 is
   still marked accepted and still describes it as the policy. It is a working,
   measured library facility with no production consumer; treat it as such
   until that decision is revisited.

   Determinism becomes event-sourced: replaying the identical operation
   history (records / corrections / deletes, in order) reproduces the
   instrument bit-exactly, because the corrections draw from the same rng
   stream. The seed ALONE now reproduces only a from-scratch retrain — a
   saved file carries the live rng state (format v2, below) so a reloaded
   instrument continues exactly where it left off.

   Zeroing the velocity at entry is what makes that cheap: it turns the
   momentum arrays into transient scratch instead of hidden persistent state,
   so the file needs one extra word (rng), not four extra weight arrays.
   A converged net's velocities are already ~0; measured cost of the zeroing:
   every correction metric identical to 4 decimals.

   PART 8d — THE INSTANT TRAINER  (ELM: freeze the randomness, solve the rest)

   The third trainer, and the fastest thing in this file by two orders of
   magnitude: retrain at 50 examples in ~0.2 ms estimated on the S3 (nh=12),
   300-425x the 600-epoch backprop path. The trick is to stop training half
   the network. Draw the hidden layer once from the seed and FREEZE it; the
   output layer is then a linear least-squares problem with an exact
   closed-form answer — one (nh+1)x(nh+1) Cholesky solve, no epochs, no
   iteration, no possibility of divergence (the ridged normal matrix is
   symmetric positive definite BY CONSTRUCTION). This idea has a name in the
   literature — extreme learning machine, ELM — and a 20-year argument about
   whether it deserves one; we use it because it is measured to work here.

   Two findings make it work in float32 on this network:

   GAIN. The backprop init (1/sqrt(n_in)) relies on training to grow the
   weights. Frozen, at that scale, tanh of a [0,1] input barely bends -- the
   random features are nearly collinear and the normal matrix is numerically
   rank-deficient. The frozen layer is drawn at 2/sqrt(n_in) instead, wide
   enough that the features have real capacity.

   PROVENANCE OF THE 2/sqrt(n_in), settled 2026-08-30. This comment used to
   cite a measured optimum from a sweep that was not in the tree, and then said
   plainly that the number was unsupported. The sweep IS reachable through the
   public API -- iris_train_elm_ex takes gain_w and gain_b -- so it was re-run
   and is now docs/gain-sweep.c, one command to reproduce. Mean held-out error
   over 4 target shapes x 16 seeds x {8,20,50} demonstrations x nh {12,24,48},
   gain = M/sqrt(n_in):

       M         0.25   0.50   1.00   1.50   2.00   3.00   4.00   8.00
       error    .1143  .1025  .0946  .0919  .0905  .0894  .0920  .1087

   The structural argument holds: M=2 beats the backprop init at M=1 by 4.3%.
   The minimum is BROAD and M=2 sits inside it. Stated honestly, M=3 is
   marginally better (1.2%) and the optimum drifts upward with width -- best at
   1.5 for nh=12 and at 3.0 for nh=48 -- so 2 is a good constant rather than
   the best one, and it stays because moving it would move every frozen hash in
   the audit for a 1.2% gain.

   RIDGE, MANDATORY. Even with the wider gain, the unridged float32 normal
   matrix failed Cholesky in EVERY realistic scenario measured -- including 20
   well-spread examples. The ridge is relative (lam0 * trace/(nh+1), so it
   scales with the data) and escalates deterministically: double lambda on a
   failed factorisation, at most 8 times, report the count. If escalation was
   needed the status says IRIS_RIDGE_ESCALATED -- the result is valid, the data
   was harder than usual. The campaign behind that: docs/adr/0009-ridge-is-mandatory.md.

   The solved instrument is an ordinary iris instrument: same w1/b1/w2/b2
   arrays, same iris_predict, saves and loads as a normal file. The solve
   targets logit space -- the exact inverse of our sigmoid -- so the shipping
   forward pass lands on the normalized targets. Stated honestly: that makes it
   a bounded-output VARIANT of the backprop head, not an equivalent.

   THE 4.6e-2 FIGURE, SCOPED. It measures logit-space-sigmoid ELM against
   linear-head ELM -- an internal ablation between two ELM variants
   (docs/adr/0008-elm-same-network-better-math.md). It is NOT the
   ELM-vs-backprop gap, which is not bounded pointwise anywhere in this repo.
   Do not cite it as one.

   REROLL is the reason to love it: a new seed literally IS a new frozen random
   layer, undiluted by any training -- measurably steadier at the demos and
   livelier in the gaps. The purest form of "same examples, different
   instrument" this project has. That corner lives at nh >= 8: four frozen
   random features cannot recall five demos, so ELM refuses nh < 8 outright
   rather than shipping a config that breaks the reroll promise. Numbers and
   the recommended lam0 per width: docs/adr/0008-elm-same-network-better-math.md.

   Determinism: the hidden layer is redrawn from k->seed by a LOCAL rng
   (k->rng is never touched -- a closed-form solve is not an event in the
   correction history), accumulation order is fixed by example order, and the
   escalation schedule is fixed. Same seed + same examples => bit-identical
   weights, verified at nh 12/24/48.

   PART 9 — SAVING

   A trained instrument has to be a thing you can put somewhere and get back.
   The file carries the weights AND the examples, so whoever receives it can
   keep working rather than inheriting a sealed box.

   Magic number and version go first so that a file from 2026 can still be
   recognised — or politely refused — in 2036.

   FORMAT v2 is format v1 plus ONE uint32 — the live rng state — inserted
   right after the 8-word header, so that save/load is transparent to the
   correction chain rather than quietly forking it.
   (docs/adr/0006-format-v2-one-word-v1-loader-permanent.md)

   FORMAT v3 changes NO BYTES AT ALL. Same header, same nine words, same
   payload, same length. What it changes is the MEANING of the weights: a v3
   file was trained with inputs scaled to [-1,+1], a v1 or v2 file with
   inputs scaled to [0,1]. The version number is the only thing that can tell
   them apart, so the version number is what selects the scaling — not a
   build flag, not a global, not the caller. iris_load sets k->in_center from
   h[1] and nothing else ever writes it except iris_init (which starts every
   fresh instrument at v3) and iris_internal_set_legacy_norm (which the audit uses to
   hold the pre-v3 training path against its frozen hash).

   WHAT BREAKS IF SOMEONE DELETES THE v1/v2 PATH, and it is not a load
   failure — that would be survivable, because it is loud. It is SILENT: the
   file still loads, every field arrives intact, the instrument reports itself
   trained and plays, and every prediction is wrong, because weights fitted
   against inputs in [0,1] are being fed inputs in [-1,+1]. The mapping is not
   degraded, it is a DIFFERENT mapping. The musician loads the instrument they
   practised for a year, hears something else, and has nothing to point at —
   the exact failure Fiebrink & Sonami (NIME 2020) describe. Audit check 11
   loads a frozen v1 file and compares the prediction BITS, so deleting the
   branch fails in one run.

   THE v1 LOADER IS PERMANENT. Old files load byte-identically to the old
   behaviour, forever. Fiebrink & Sonami's users lost technique to
   retraining; a frozen old model is sacred and this loader is the vow.
   ========================================================================== */

#define IRIS_MAGIC 0x4B455745u  /* "EWEK" */
/* WHICH OF YOUR FILES ARE PROTECTED, AND WHICH ARE NOT.

   Formats 4 and 5 carry a checksum: every single-bit change anywhere in the
   file is detected and the load is refused. Formats 1, 2 and 3 predate it and
   never will, because adding one would break the promise that an old
   instrument keeps loading for ever.

   That has a consequence worth stating plainly rather than leaving for someone
   to discover. An instrument restored from a v1 or v2 file keeps the legacy
   [0,1] input scaling for life -- its weights mean nothing else -- and so it
   saves itself as v2, which has no checksum. From then on THAT instrument's
   files have no corruption detection, permanently, and nothing announces it.

   iris_input_scaling(k) reports the same bit: 0 means legacy [0,1], which
   means its files are unchecksummed. A caller that cares should ask.

   AND ONE THING THE CHECKSUM CANNOT DO, WHICH IS WORTH SAYING HERE RATHER THAN
   LEAVING TO BE DISCOVERED. iris_save copies every field into your buffer and
   computes the checksum over the buffer AFTERWARDS. So the checksum certifies
   the bytes that were written -- not that they all came from the same instant.
   If the instrument changes while the copy is running (a second thread, an
   interrupt, the sliced trainer driven from a timer) the buffer holds a
   mixture of two instruments, and the checksum is computed over the mixture
   and therefore matches. By construction, always. A reviewer raced saves
   against training and got 4,096 of 4,096 torn files loading clean, 32 of them
   badly wrong while reporting healthy.

   This is already out of contract -- see the threading note in PART 1: one
   instrument belongs to one thread. It is called out again here because this
   is the one corruption the guard rail specifically cannot catch, and a
   checksum that passes is exactly the evidence that would persuade you the
   file is fine. Do not save an instrument that something else may be touching.
   There is no allocation and no lock in this library to do it for you. */
/* FORMAT v6 CHANGES NO BYTES AT ALL -- the same trick v3 used. Same header,
   same payload, same length, same checksum. What it changes is one fact ABOUT
   the instrument: v6 means "this was saved before it was ever fitted".

   Why it has to exist. iris_load used to set trained = 1 unconditionally, so
   record-save-load-play on a never-trained instrument ran the forward pass over
   the random weights iris_reseed left, returned numbers that vary with the
   gesture, and reported IRIS_STATUS_OK. The unfitted guard in iris_predict is
   the defence the front page calls the one thing to get right, and the loader
   walked around it. Nothing in the bytes could tell the two apart, because
   untrained weights are just weights.

   v1-v5 keep meaning exactly what they always meant -- fitted -- so no file
   ever written changes meaning, which is the promise adr/0006 makes. */
#define IRIS_FORMAT_V6 6u       /* v5 layout, and it was NOT fitted when saved */
#define IRIS_FORMAT 5u          /* what iris_save writes: v4 + the smoothing word */

/* CRC32 (IEEE 802.3), computed a bit at a time so there is no 1 KB table to
   carry onto a microcontroller. A few KB takes microseconds and it only runs on
   save and load, never while playing.

   WHY A SAVED INSTRUMENT NEEDS ONE. The file is weights — raw floats with no
   redundancy. Flip one bit in flash, or lose power halfway through an SD write,
   and every field still parses: the magic matches, the shape matches, the sizes
   match, and the instrument loads and plays something subtly wrong with nothing

     absolutely. So it is written from k->in_center, never from a constant.

     Stamping IRIS_FORMAT unconditionally is the bug this comment exists to

     keeps the legacy scaling (it must — its weights mean nothing else), and
     if the musician then re-trains and saves, a constant here would label
     [0,1] weights as v3. The next load would read that label, switch to
     [-1,+1], and play a DIFFERENT INSTRUMENT out of a file that round-trips
     every weight bit perfectly. Measured before the fix: 0.427 of full scale
     on a 441-probe grid, from the ordinary open / train / save the app does

/* THE ONLY WAY AN OLD INSTRUMENT EVER CHANGES SCALING, AND THE CALLER HAS TO
   ASK FOR IT BY NAME.

   A v1/v2 instrument keeps the legacy [0,1] scaling for as long as it exists,
   including across re-training and re-saving, because its weights mean
   nothing else and iris_save now labels it honestly as v2. That is the safe
   default and it is the right one. But it leaves an old instrument stuck on
   the worse-conditioned fit for ever, and silently declining to improve is
   its own kind of dishonesty.

   So: this. It throws the old weights away and re-fits the SAME stored
   demonstrations under the centred scaling — the musician's recorded
   gestures are raw sensor values in their own units and mean exactly the
   same thing under either scaling, which is why the re-fit is legitimate.
   What comes out is a v3 instrument that saves as v3.

   ⚠️ NO PRODUCTION CALLER. This comment used to claim an application already
   depended on it. Nothing does: the only callers are tests/audit.c. Keep the
   function -- a v1 or v2 file in the wild will need it -- but do not cite a
   dependency that does not exist.

   It is a NEW FIT, not a conversion: predictions move by about the fit error
   (measured 0.0447 worst-case on the audit's reference instrument, check 30).
   The musician must be told that and must choose it — hence a function they
   call, not something iris_load does behind their back. Fiebrink & Sonami's
   users lost technique to retraining they did not ask for.

/* ==========================================================================
   PART 10 — THE SECOND ALGORITHM  (k-NN blending and 1-NN snapping)

   A different character of instrument, not a quality tier. Desktop
   Wekinator ships k-NN as its default for discrete (classifier) outputs;
   until now iris only answered the continuous case. These two functions
   add both modes with ZERO training, ZERO seed, and ZERO extra arena
   bytes: they are a weighted read of the example store the instrument
   already carries. The examples ARE the model — the design rule of this
   whole file, taken to its logical end.

   Semantics, stated as design and not as apology:

     - THIS ALGORITHM DOES NOT REROLL. There is no seed and nothing random;
       the same examples always give the same instrument, bit for bit. It
       is sampler-like where the MLP is morph-like: it plays back and
       blends your demonstrations.

     - EXACT RECALL. Standing on a demonstration returns that
       demonstration — the property backprop never quite delivers (the MLP
       audibly misses its own demos by ~1%).

     - SEAMS, ON PURPOSE. Between two demos the output can step 31x more
       sharply than its mean step (measured; the MLP's morph is 1.9x).
       That is the sampler character, documented, not hidden.

     - STRUCTURAL SAFETY. Output is a convex combination of demonstrated
       outputs: it cannot NaN and cannot leave the range you demonstrated,
       whatever the input does.

     - THE HONEST FLOOR. The MLP generalises better at EVERY example count
       measured (2.4x at 5 examples, 2.1x at 200). Choose k-NN for its
       character or for discrete outputs, never for accuracy.

   Distances live in the min-max normalised input space — the same space
   iris_novelty uses — so a millimetre sensor and a g-force sensor count
   equally. Call iris_fit_ranges(k) (or any train) after editing examples and
   before predicting, exactly as iris_novelty already requires. Ties resolve
   to the earliest-recorded example, the same rule as Weka's
   LinearNNSearch, the engine under desktop Wekinator's classifier — so
   decisions are comparable ("Wekinator-compatible semantics"; the desktop
   Java binary itself has not been run against this code, and the label
   stays this honest until it has).

   Every v1 file ever saved gains this mode with zero migration: the
   examples and ranges are already in the file. That was the point of the
   format. Algorithm choice is a runtime call in v0.2; a persisted
   algorithm-selector tag waits for the next format bump.
